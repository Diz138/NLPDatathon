These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic-based assay that allows real-time observation of the expression of \u03b2-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression\u2014the burst size and frequency\u2014can be either determined directly from real-time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady-state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels7,8, and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system-wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain\u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) has been the standard reporter for gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells9,10,11,12. Only active as a tetramer, a single molecule of \u03b2-gal can produce a large number of fluorescent product molecules by hydrolysing a synthetic fluorogenic substrate (Fig. 1b), leading to amplification of the fluorescent signal, as was first demonstrated in 1961 (ref. 13). However, given its potential as a high-sensitivity cellular reporter, \u03b2-gal has an Achilles' heel: its fluorescent products are not retained in the cell10, because efflux pumps on the cell membrane actively and efficiently expel foreign organic molecules from the cytoplasm14 (see Supplementary Information). As the fluorescent product molecules are pumped to the surrounding medium and rapidly diffuse away, the advantage of enzymatic amplification is lost.Figure 1: \n                        Single reporter molecule sensitivity in a microfluidic device.\na, Schematic diagram of the microfluidic chamber used for the enzymatic assay. Cells are trapped inside a volume of 100\u2009pl, formed by compression of a flow channel by two control channels. b, Enzymatic amplification: hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate FDG by the reporter enzyme \u03b2-gal yields a fluorescent product, fluorescein. c, Differential interference contrast (DIC) image of a microfluidic chip after actuation of the control channels.

The discrete slopes are due to, in decreasing order, 3, 2, 1, 0 (autohydrolysis) \u03b2-gal molecules. f, A histogram of hydrolysis rates (48 chambers). The red curve is a fit to the data with three gaussians of equal widths. The peaks are attributed to 0, 1 and 2 enzyme molecules per chamber. The distribution is well-fitted by a Poisson distribution (black line), with an average of 0.7 \u03b2-gal molecules per chamber.Full size imageTo circumvent the efflux problem, we trap cells in closed microfluidic chambers, such that the fluorescent product expelled from the cells can accumulate in the small volume of the chambers, recovering the fluorescence signal due to enzymatic amplification. The fast efflux rate and short mixing time of the fluorescent molecules in the miniature chambers guarantee that the fluorescence signal outside the cells accurately reflects the enzymatic activity inside. The microfluidic device is made of a soft polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and consists of a flow layer that contains the cells and a top control layer (Fig. 1a)15,16. Actuation of two adjacent valves in the control layer forms an enclosure of dimensions 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 10\u2009\u00b5m3 (100\u2009pl) in which cells can be trapped and cultured17,18 (Fig. 1c, d; see also Supplementary Fig. S1). The microfluidic chip is mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope and translated by a motorized stage, allowing multiplexing of data acquisition by repeatedly scanning the chambers. Typically, 100 chambers can be scanned within less than 2\u2009min. Fluorescence is excited with a tightly focused laser beam (Fig. 1a) that does not directly illuminate the cell, avoiding cellular autofluorescence and photo-damage to the cell.We first show the ability to detect single enzyme molecules using this technique by injecting a diluted solution of purified \u03b2-gal enzyme and 300\u2009\u00b5M of the fluorogenic substrate fluorescein-di-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (FDG) into the chambers19. Fluorescence signals from different chambers increase with time, and the slopes give the rates of hydrolysis (Fig. 1e). The distribution of hydrolysis rates measured in the different chambers shows quantized and evenly spaced peaks (Fig. 1f). We attribute these discrete peaks to integer numbers of \u03b2-gal molecules. The spacing between the peaks is 60\u2009pM\u2009min-1, which gives a calibration for the rate of increase in fluorescein concentration corresponding to one enzyme molecule in a chamber.Another challenge for using \u03b2-gal to monitor gene expression in live cells is that the cell wall acts as a barrier for FDG influx. We quantify this effect in E. coli by measuring the hydrolysis rate for live cells compared to cells treated with chloroform, which completely permeabilizes cell membrane (Supplementary Fig. S4a). The ratio of hydrolysis rates between these two cases is defined as the permeability ratio, and is measured to be R = 13 at 300\u2009\u00b5m FDG. To increase FDG influx, we transformed E. coli cells with a plasmid conferring ampicillin resistance and grew the cells in media with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (see Methods). Under these conditions, cell wall synthesis is partially inhibited, making the cells more permeable to FDG, as evident by a lower value of R = 2 \u00b1 0.3 (Supplementary Fig. S4b). In determining the number of enzyme molecules in live cells below, R = 2 is used as a correction factor to the in vitro calibration (Fig. 1f).We then monitored gene expression in live E. coli cells in real time. \u03b2-gal is expressed from the lacZ gene on the chromosomal DNA, which is under the control of the lac promoter. Cells are grown in glucose-containing medium without inducer to exponential phase; hence the expression level is highly repressed20. We observed abrupt changes in hydrolysis rates in chambers with dividing cells, as shown in Fig. 2a, b. These step-wise increases in the rates indicate the stochastic burst-like expression of new \u03b2-gal molecules. We attribute the bursts to stochastic and transient dissociation events of the Lac repressor from the promoter, followed by transcription of mRNA, which is then translated into a few copies of the reporter protein before the mRNA is degraded.Figure 2: \n                        Quantitative real-time measurement of individual protein expression events in live \nE. coli\n cells.\n \u03b2-gal is under the control of a repressed lac promoter. a, Trace of a chamber containing dividing cells shows abrupt changes in hydrolysis rates (arrows on black curve). An empty chamber shows a constant background (red curve). b, Discrete jumps in \u03b2-gal number are due to burst-like production of proteins. The number of \u03b2-gal molecules is calculated by taking the time derivative of the traces in a and compensating for fluorescein photobleaching (Supplementary Information). c, Histogram of copy number of \u03b2-gal molecules per burst. The distribution is well-fitted with an exponential function (black line), with an average of five proteins per burst, and is a consequence of exponential cellular lifetime of the mRNA.Full size imageThe expression of proteins from a given gene can be characterized by two key parameters: the average frequency of expression bursts per cell cycle, a; and the average number of protein molecules per burst, b. Under conditions of exponential growth in minimal medium, the burst frequency for protein expression from the repressed E. coli lacZ gene is measured to be a = 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 bursts per cell cycle. The average burst size is measured to be b = 5 \u00b1 2 enzymes, or 20 \u00b1 8 monomers per burst, which is consistent with biochemical estimates of 25\u201330 \u03b2-gal monomers per mRNA21,22.This real-time assay also allows us to measure the distribution of the number of enzymes produced per burst (Fig. 2c). It can be well fitted with an exponential distribution, P(n) = C\u2009exp(- n/b), where n is the number of \u03b2-gal molecules per burst and C is a normalization constant. We attribute this distribution to the fact that the cellular lifetime of the mRNA is exponentially distributed21,23. Previously only theoretically predicted1,24, the exponential P(n) can be accounted for by the competition between mRNA degradation by RNaseE and translation by ribosome. Our single-molecule experiment demonstrates the ability to provide quantitative real-time information on gene expression in a live cell.Stochasticity of gene expression is exhibited not only in the temporal evolution of protein production in a single cell, but also in the distribution of protein copy number in a population of cells at a particular time. Such distributions have been measured using flow cytometry3,4 or fluorescence microscopy2,5,6, but have been limited to only high expression levels. Our method allows measurements of the reporter's distribution in a cell population with single copy sensitivity.To do this, we treated E. coli cells with chloroform, which completely permeabilizes cell membrane and stops protein production, while keeping existing \u03b2-gal molecules active inside the cell (Fig. 3b, inset). The treated cells are immediately injected into the microfluidic device together with FDG and the hydrolysis rate is measured. We first demonstrate the detection of single enzyme molecules inside those chloroform-treated cells. The histogram of hydrolysis rates of all chambers shows quantized peaks (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S12). The spacing between peaks is in agreement with that measured in vitro (Fig. 1f).Figure 3: \n                        Steady-state protein copy number distributions in a population of cells.\na, Histogram of FDG hydrolysis rates from 48 chambers containing chloroform-treated E. coli cells shows discrete, evenly spaced peaks, with spacing equal to that measured with purified enzyme (Fig. 1f). b, Copy number distribution of \u03b2-gal molecules in chambers containing a single E. coli cell, under the repressed condition (120 cells). The solid line shows a gamma distribution (equation (1)) with a = 0.16 bursts\u2009per cell cycle and b = 7.8 \u03b2-gal molecules per burst. Inset: average hydrolysis rate grows linearly with the number of cells per chamber with a slope of 0.9\u2009enzymes per cell. c, Histogram of the number of \u03b2-gal molecules in chloroform-treated yeast cells (116 cells) expressing \u03b2-gal from the repressed GAL1 promoter carried on a low copy number plasmid. The solid line is a gamma distribution with a = 0.2 and b = 1.7.Full size imageWe compiled a histogram of the number of \u03b2-gal molecules in chambers containing only a single cell (Fig. 3b) for cells cultured under the same repressed condition as in the real-time experiment. The mean of this distribution is m = 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 copies of \u03b2-gal molecules per cell, and the standard deviation is \u03c3 = 3.3. The mean agrees with the ensemble measurement of 1 \u00b1 0.5 \u03b2-gal per cell, as well as the observation that the average number of \u03b2-gal molecules per chamber increases with the number of cells trapped in a chamber with a slope of 0.9\u2009enzymes per cell (Fig. 3b inset).We created a model to relate the measured steady-state protein copy number distributions to the parameters a and b that are defined above. We used a continuous form of the master equation25 to analytically describe that distribution given the burst dynamics of protein production. We assume that: (1) distribution of protein molecules produced per expression event is exponential; (2) expression events are temporally uncorrelated; and (3) protein molecule copy numbers are halved at cell division. At steady-state, protein production is balanced by protein dilution due to cell growth and division. We found that the steady-state probability distribution of protein number per cell, p(x), is a gamma distribution, which is uniquely determined by the parameters a and b (Supplementary Information): where \u0393 denotes the gamma function. The parameters a and b are related to the mean, m, and standard deviation, \u03c3, by a = m2/\u03c32 and b = \u03c32/m. Figure 3b shows that the data fits well with equation (1), with b = 7.8 \u00b1 2.6 reporters per burst and a = 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 bursts per cell cycle, which are consistent with the real-time data above within error bars. This demonstrates that the information about the underlying dynamic process, namely the values of a and b, is preserved in both the temporal fluctuations in a single cell and the instantaneous variability within a population.Notably, the profile of p(x) with a < 1 that we measured for the repressed lac operon is distinct from p(x) with a > 1 that was measured previously for the induced lac operon2. These correspond to two different regimes of equation (1), schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. For a < 1, p(x) peaks at zero and a large fraction of cells contains no \u03b2-gal regardless of the burst size b (Fig. 4a); however, for a > 1, p(x) peaks at a non-zero x and most cells contain \u03b2-gal (Fig. 4b).Figure 4: \n                        Two regimes of stochasticity in protein expression.\nProtein molecules are produced in bursts (red), in addition to existing molecules (blue), and diluted upon cell division, leading to a steady-state distribution, p(x), of protein copy number, x, in the cell population. a, With a < 1, p(x) peaks at x = 0 and a large fraction of cells do not contain a single copy of the protein regardless of the burst size, b. The repressed lac operon is well described by this regime. b, With a > 1, most cells contain the protein at some level. Both regimes can be described by the gamma distribution (equation (1)).Full size imageThe profile of p(x) for a < 1 may be significant for the response of a population of E. coli cells to an increase in lactose concentration, which is transported into the cell by Lac permease. Because \u03b2-gal and Lac permease are expressed from the same operon, the large subpopulation of cells containing no \u03b2-gal would generally have no Lac permease. These cells cannot respond to a rise of lactose concentration in the environment, and thus are distinct from cells containing permease, which can respond and induce further expression of the lac operon by way of positive feedback. Thus, a < 1 provides a mechanism for \u2018all-or-none\u2019 induction responses that cells exhibit under suboptimal inducer concentrations11,26.This microfluidic assay can be applied to other cell types expressing \u03b2-gal as a reporter. We demonstrate applicability by measuring low-level expression from repressed promoters in yeast and mammalian cells. Figure 3c shows the distribution of reporter number in a population of chloroform-treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yKT32) cells expressing \u03b2-gal from the repressed GAL1 promoter. Here, the promoter\u2013reporter fusion is carried on a low copy number plasmid. Cells were grown in the presence of glucose, such that the promoter is expected to be highly repressed. The average expression level is measured to be 0.4 \u00b1 0.07 reporters per cell, with \u03c3 = 0.6. Using the above model (equation (1)) we can extract a and b from the measured mean and \u03c3: a = 0.2 \u00b1 0.08 bursts per cell cycle and b = 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 reporters per burst. This is consistent with our real-time experiments with permeable mutant yeast strain (pdr1-\u2009pdr3-) in which we do not observe abrupt large jumps as seen with E. coli. The low burst size in this case may reflect the non-optimal codon usage of the bacterial reporter gene in yeast. Finally, we measured \u03b2-gal expression also from the ROSA26 promoter in embryonic mouse stem cells (ES 54A). The average expression level was 425 \u00b1 80 enzymes per cell with \u03c3 = 375 (Supplementary Information).The single cell version of the \u03b2-gal assay9 presented here exhibits single molecule sensitivity for single prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This method, together with other newly developed single cell and single molecule techniques at the mRNA27,28 and protein29 levels, opens up possibilities for studying low-level gene expression in single cells of diverse cell types (for example, transcription factors involved in gene regulation, or the leakiness of supposedly silenced promoters in differentiated cells). The ease of scaling up the microfluidic assay will enable characterization of gene expression on a whole-genome scale, especially in the unexplored regime of low expression levels.MethodsCell strains and growth conditionsE. coli K12 (MG1655) cells are transformed with a medium copy number plasmid, pBR293.3, which confers ampicillin resistance. Cells were cultured in M9 media supplemented with amino acids and vitamins. Experiments were performed at 30\u2009\u00b0C. Under these conditions cells grow with a cell cycle time of about 145\u2009min (Supplementary Fig. S1). S. cerevisiae cells (yKT0032) express \u03b2-gal from the GAL1 promoter, carried on a low-copy 2\u2009\u00b5m plasmid (pYES2-lacZ). Cells were cultured in SD glucose \u2013ura medium (BD Bioscience) at 30\u2009\u00b0C. Mouse embryonic stem cells ES54A (Smo + / - , Rosa26 lacZ+) and ES17 (lacZ-) from a 129SVJ background were cultured in a defined medium to prevent differentiation. Single cell suspension is derived by adding trypsin to the cell culture and resuspending.Microfluidic chip fabricationThe master mould for the bottom channels is made by spin-coating positive photoresist (Shipley SPR 220-7, MicroChem) onto a silicon wafer (University Wafer) to a height of 7\u2009\u00b5m. After patterning with high-resolution transparency mask (PageWorks), the features are rounded by heating15,16. The control layer master is patterned with negative photoresist at 40\u2009\u00b5m height. PDMS (10:1 Dow Corning Sylgard 184 A:B, Ellsworth Adhesives) is spun onto the bottom master at 2,000\u2009r.p.m. for 1\u2009min and partially cured. Control layer PDMS mould is also partially cured and baked at the thickness of 5\u2009mm. The two PDMS pieces are aligned and cured overnight. The two-layer device is cut out, plasma oxidized for 3\u2009min and bonded permanently to a coverslip.Fluorescence detectionFluorescence was excited by a tightly focused beam of a 488-nm Ar-ion laser (Melles Griot), with a power of 27\u2009\u00b5W. A high NA objective lens (Nikon 60 \u00d7 Plan Apo NA = 1.4) was used in an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon) for excitation and collection of the fluorescence signal. A CCD camera (Andor Technology) with on-chip amplification and a large dynamic range was used for detection. Filters used were: excitation, 488\u2009nm narrow bandpass; emission, 535\u2009nm/50 bandpass; dichroic, 495\u2009nm high pass (Chroma Corp). Measurement of signals from multiple chambers was multiplexed by scanning the microfluidic chip using a motorized stage, ASI MS2000 XY (ASI).Data analysisAnalysis of the fluorescent signal was performed using Matlab (Mathworks). Signal was averaged over the 100 brightest pixels from each image, and background was subtracted. The measured fluorescence time traces F(t) were corrected for photobleaching and time derivative was taken to obtain the number of enzymes in a chamber as a function of time. A median filter of length 11 was used to smooth F(t). With a sampling rate of once every 20\u2009s per chamber, the effective time resolution is about 4\u2009min. The error in calculating the parameters a and b from the copy number distribution was estimated with bootstrap analysis30. The original data set was re-sampled 1,000 times. The a and b parameters were calculated for each of those re-sampled data sets, from which the error was estimated. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Information.\n\n\nReferencesMcAdams, H. H. & Arkin, A. Stochastic mechanisms in gene expression. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.

That's familiar enough and uncontroversial. But gene expression has not been directly observed in real time in a live cell on a single-molecule basis. A new live-cell assay system has now been developed that makes such single-molecule observations possible, and can reveal the working of gene expression in live cells. The assay, tested in Escherichia coli, yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells, shows that protein molecules are produced in bursts. The distribution of molecules in each burst is a measure of gene expression levels, which can be compared under different conditions. This has the potential to take the sensitivity of gene expression profiling well beyond that possible today.show all\n\n\nSectionsFiguresReferencesAbstractMainMethodsReferencesAcknowledgementsAuthor informationEthics declarationsSupplementary informationRights and permissionsAbout this articleThis article is cited byComments\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \n                        Single reporter molecule sensitivity in a microfluidic device.\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 2: \n                        Quantitative real-time measurement of individual protein expression events in live \nE. coli\n cells.\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 3: \n                        Steady-state protein copy number distributions in a population of cells.\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 4: \n                        Two regimes of stochasticity in protein expression.\nView in articleFull size image\nMcAdams, H.

At the root of this knowledge gap is the absence of a method that enables whole-organ imaging. Herein, we present techniques for tissue clearing in which whole organs and bodies are rendered macromolecule-permeable and optically transparent, thereby exposing their cellular structure with intact connectivity. We describe PACT (passive clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index matching solution), a mounting media for imaging thick tissue; and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA single-molecule FISH, long-term storage, and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution. These methods are applicable for high-resolution, high-content mapping and phenotyping of normal and pathological elements within intact organs and bodies.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (306KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightLoading...Recommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate an evolution of sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH+). We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells\u2014with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution\u2014in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a standard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling of seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and their spatial organization in tissues. In addition, seqFISH+ reveals subcellular mRNA localization patterns in cells and ligand\u2013receptor pairs across neighbouring cells. This technology demonstrates the ability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-driven studies of biological processes in situ.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainSpatial genomics, the analysis of the transcriptome and other genomic information directly in the native context of tissues, is crucial to many fields in biology, including neuroscience and developmental biology. Pioneering work in single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) showed that individual mRNA molecules could be accurately detected in cells6,7. Development of sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH) to impart a temporal barcode on RNAs through multiple rounds of hybridization allowed many molecules to be multiplexed1,2,3. seqFISH was recently shown to scale to the genome level in vitro8, and could be applied for nascent transcription active sites9.Nevertheless, global profiling of mRNA in cells is hindered by the optical density of transcripts in cells: each mRNA occupies a diffraction-limited spot in the image and there are tens to hundreds of thousands of mRNAs per cell, depending on the cell type. Thus, optical crowding prevents mRNAs from being resolved and has impeded all implementations of spatial profiling experiments3,4,5. For example, in situ sequencing methods detected only around 500 transcripts per cell4,5,10 because of the low efficiency and large dot size of rolling-circle amplification, whereas seqFISH detected thousands of transcripts per cell3. We previously proposed combining super-resolution microscopy with FISH11 to overcome this crowding problem. However, existing super-resolution localization microscopy12,13 relies on the\u00a0detection of single dye molecules, which emit a limited number of photons and only work robustly in optically thin (less than 1\u00a0\u00b5m) samples.To enable discovery-driven approaches in situ, it is essential to scale up the spatial multiplexed methods to the genome level. To date, spatial methods have relied on existing genomics methods, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)\u00a0analysis, to identify target genes, and they\u00a0serve only\u00a0to map cell types identified by scRNA-seq. At the level of hundreds and even a thousand genes, spatial methods cannot be used as a de novo discovery-driven tool; this is a major disadvantage of the technology. In addition, many genes are expressed in a spatially dependent fashion independent of cell types14, and this\u00a0information is lost when analysing dissociated cells.Here we demonstrate seqFISH+, which achieves super-resolution imaging and multiplexing of 10,000 genes in a\u00a0single cell using sequential hybridizations and imaging with a standard confocal microscope. The key to seqFISH+ is expansion of the barcode base palette from four or five colours\u2014as used in seqFISH1,3 and in situ sequencing experiments4,5\u2014to a much larger palette of \u2018pseudocolours\u2019 (Fig.\u00a01a) by sequential hybridization. By using 60 pseudocolour channels, we effectively dilute mRNA molecules into 60 separate images and enable each mRNA dot to be localized below the diffraction limit12,15,16, before recombining the images to reconstruct a super-resolution image. We separate the 60 pseudocolours into three fluorescent channels (Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3b and Alexa Fluor 647) and generate barcodes only within each channel to avoid chromatic aberrations between channels. Each channel can contain 203 (8,000) barcoded genes, giving a total of 24,000 genes when repeating this pseudocolour imaging four times, with one round used for error correction3.Fig. 1: seqFISH+ resolves optical crowding and enables transcriptome profiling in situ.a, Schematic of the seqFISH+ protocol. Primary probes (24 per gene) against 10,000 genes are hybridized in cells. Overhang sequences (I\u2013IV) on the primary probes correspond to four rounds of barcoding. Only one twentieth of the total genes in each fluorescent channel are labelled by readout probes in each pseudocolour hybridization readout round (hyb), lowering the density of transcripts in each image. mRNA dots in each pseudocolour can then be localized by Gaussian fitting and collapsed into a super-resolved image (dashed blue outline). Each gene is barcoded within only one fluorescent channel (Methods). b, Comparison with seqFISH implemented\u00a0with expansion microscopy (seqFISH-expansion, green line), covering 24,000 genes. Imaging is eightfold faster using seqFISH+ with 60 pseudocolours (blue line) than with seqFISH-expansion (see\u00a0Methods). c, Image of a NIH/3T3 cell from one round of hybridization (n\u00a0=\u00a0227 cells; scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm). Expanded inset shows individual mRNAs (scale bar, 1\u00a0\u03bcm). Different mRNAs are decoded within a diffraction-limited region, magnified from the inset (scale bars, 100\u00a0nm). The number in each panel corresponds to the pseudocolour round in which each mRNA was detected, with no dots being detected during the other pseudocolour rounds in the channel (640 nm).Full size imageAs imaging time is the main bottleneck in spatial transcriptomics experiments, imaging for seqFISH+ is eightfold faster compared to implementing seqFISH with expansion microscopy17 (Fig.\u00a01b). Using seqFISH, an equivalent 60-fold expansion of the sample would require four colours with eight barcoding rounds and 60-fold volume expansion, resulting in 1,920 images per field of view (FOV) to cover 47 (that is, 16,384) genes. By contrast, seqFISH+ acquires 60 pseudocolours with four barcoding rounds, giving 240 images per FOV to cover 24,000 genes\u2014an eightfold reduction in imaging time. Furthermore, a large number of pseudocolours and a shorter four-unit barcode decrease the errors that accumulate over barcode rounds.To demonstrate transcriptome-level profiling in cells, we first applied seqFISH+ to cleared NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells18,19,20 (Fig.\u00a01c, Extended Data Figs.\u00a01, 2). We randomly selected 10,000 genes, avoiding highly abundant housekeeping genes, such as ribosomal proteins. These 10,000 genes sum up to\u00a0more than 125,000 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values, with a wide range of expression levels (from 0 to 995.1 FPKM). All 24,000 genes in the fibroblast transcriptome add up to around 420,000 FPKM21, only a threefold higher density than the 10,000-gene experiment, and this can be accommodated with the current scheme, or with more channels or pseudocolours.Overall, 35,492\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012,222 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) transcripts are detected per cell (Fig.\u00a02a). The 10,000-gene seqFISH+ data are highly reproducible and strongly correlated with RNA-seq data21 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.80), RNA sequential probing of targets (SPOTs)8 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.80) and smFISH (R\u00a0=\u00a00.87) (Fig.\u00a02b\u2013d, Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a, b). Each of the three fluorescent channels was decoded independently and correlated well with RNA-seq and smFISH (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a, c). The false-positive rate per cell is 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) per barcode (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d, e). Comparison with 60 genes from smFISH showed that the detection efficiency of seqFISH+ was 49%, which is highly sensitive compared with scRNA-seq.Fig. 2: seqFISH+ profiles 10,000 genes in cells with high efficiency.a, Approximately 47,000 mRNAs (coloured dots) were identified in a NIH/3T3 cell from a single z-section (scale bar, \u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm). Inset shows the transcripts decoded in cell protrusions (n\u00a0=\u00a0227 cells; scale bar, \u00a0100\u00a0nm). b, seqFISH+ replicates in NIH/3T3 cells are highly reproducible (replicate 1, n\u00a0=\u00a0103 cells; replicate 2, n\u00a0=\u00a0124 cells). c, d, seqFISH+ correlates well with RNA-seq (n\u00a0=\u00a09,875 genes) (c)\u00a0and smFISH (n\u00a0=\u00a060 genes; P\u00a0=\u00a02.26\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221219)\u00a0(d). The efficiency of seqFISH+ is about 49% compared to smFISH. Error bars in d represent s.e.m. In b\u2013d, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 (Pearson\u2019s R, two-tailed P values).Full size imageseqFISH+ enables visualization of the subcellular localization patterns of tens of thousands of RNA molecules in situ in single cells. Three major clusters of localization were observed, with enrichment in either nucleus\u2013perinucleus, cytoplasm or protrusions. We found many mRNAs that had not been previously localized to protrusions, in addition to those that had been identified before22,23. We further observed three distinct subclusters in the perinuclear\u2013nuclear-localized transcripts, and genes in each of these subclusters\u00a0were enriched in distinct functional roles (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03f\u2013j).To demonstrate that seqFISH+ works robustly in tissues, we used the same 10,000-gene probe set to image cells in the cortex, sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) (Fig.\u00a03a) and olfactory bulb in two separate sections of mouse brain. We collected 10,000-gene profiles for 2,963 cells (Fig.\u00a03b\u2013e), covering an area of approximately 0.5\u00a0mm2. In the cortex, cells contained on average 5,615\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03,307 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) transcripts from 3,338\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01,489 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) detected genes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a, b). We imaged only a single optical plane (0.75-\u03bcm thickness) to save imaging time. Full 3D imaging of cells with seqFISH+ can detect five-to-tenfold more transcripts per cell.Fig. 3: seqFISH+ robustly characterizes cell classes and subcellular RNA localization in brain slices.a, Schematic of the imaged regions (magenta boxes). b, Cells in a single FOV of the cortex (scale bar, 20\u00a0\u03bcm). c, Reconstruction of the 9,418 mRNAs (coloured dots) detected in a cell (scale bar, 2\u00a0\u03bcm). d, Decoded transcripts for a magnified region (n\u00a0=\u00a0523 cells; scale bar,\u00a0100\u00a0nm).

Scale bar, 20\u00a0\u03bcm.Full size imageWith an unsupervised clustering analysis24, the seqFISH+ cell clusters show clear layer structures (Fig.\u00a03h) and are strongly correlated to the clusters in an scRNA-seq25 dataset (Methods, Extended Data Figs.\u00a04c\u2013f, 5). Similar layer patterns are observed with hidden-Markov random-field (HMRF) analysis14, in which the expression patterns of neighbouring cells were taken into account (Extended Data Figs.\u00a04g\u2013i, 6).With the seqFISH+ data, we can explore the subcellular localization patterns of 10,000 mRNAs directly in the brain in a cell-type-specific fashion (Supplementary Table\u00a03). In many cell types, the transcripts for Snrnp70, a small nuclear riboprotein, and Nr4a1, a nuclear receptor, are found in the nuclear\u2013perinuclear regions. By contrast, transcripts of the Na+/K+-ATPase Atp1b2 and the kinesin Kif5a are observed near the cell peripheries in many cell types, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as glial cells. In addition, many transcripts in astrocytes, such as Gja1 and Htra1, localize to the cell periphery and processes; these results were confirmed by smFISH (Fig.\u00a03f, g, Extended Data Fig.\u00a07).We next explored the spatial organization of the SVZ (Fig.\u00a04a). We identified neural stem cells (NSCs, clusters 8, 16) expressing astrocyte markers Gja1 and Htra1, transit-amplifying progenitors (TAPs, cluster 15) expressing Ascl1, Mcm5 and Mki67, and neuroblasts expressing Dlx1 and Sp9, consistent with previous studies26. We further quantified the spatial organization of the different cell types in the SVZ (Fig.\u00a04a, Extended Data Fig.\u00a08), and found that class 12 and 17 neuroblasts are preferentially in contact, whereas TAP cells tend to associate with other TAP cells. Further investigation of the RNA velocity trajectories27 of these cells in situ with intron seqFISH9 and of their lineage relationships using MEMOIR28 would reveal further information regarding their temporal and spatial relationships.Fig. 4: seqFISH+ reveals ligand\u2013receptor repertoires in neighbouring cells and spatial organization in tissues.a, Spatial organization of distinct cell clusters in the SVZ. b, c, Spatially resolved cell-cluster maps of the mitral cell layer (MCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), granule cell layer (GCL) (b) and glomerular layer (GL) (c) (scale bars, 20\u00a0\u03bcm). Remaining FOVs are shown in Extended Data Fig.\u00a010. Note that different numbering is used for clusters in the SVZ and olfactory bulb (OB) (Supplementary Table\u00a02). d, Distinct populations of Th+ dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb with differential expression of Vgf and Trh, shown with smFISH, confirming seqFISH+ clustering analysis. e, Schematic showing ligand\u2013receptor pairs in neighbouring microglia and endothelial cells. In microglia next to endothelial cells, certain genes, such as Tpd52, are enriched compared with microglia that neighbour other cell types. f, mRNAs of Tgfb1 ligand and Acvrl1 receptor are visualized in adjacent microglia-endothelial cells by smFISH. In d, f, n\u00a0=\u00a010 FOVs, 40\u00d7 objective; scale bars, 5\u00a0\u03bcm.Full size imageNext, we examined the spatial organization of the olfactory bulb. Our clustering analysis revealed distinct classes of GABAergic interneurons, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells (Fig.\u00a04b, c), consistent with previous studies29. In the granule cell layer (GCL) at the centre of the olfactory bulb, several cell classes are observed, with an interior core consisting of immature neuroblast-like cells expressing Dlx1 and Dlx2, encased by a distinct outer layer of the GCL comprising more mature interneurons (Fig.\u00a04b, Extended Data Figs.\u00a09, 10). Excitatory clusters of cells expressing Reln and Slc17a7 are observed in the mitral cell layer as mitral cells and in the external plexiform layer and the glomerulus as tufted cells. We also found several clusters of dopaminergic neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) (Fig.\u00a04b\u2013d, Supplementary Table\u00a02). For example, cluster 1 cells express Th and the neuropeptide Vgf, and are distributed in both the glomerulus and the GCL. Similarly, Trh is enriched in a distinct set of Th+ cells (cluster 3), which are predominantly found\u00a0in the glomerulus, whereas dopaminergic neurons in clusters 5 and 22 are located\u00a0in the GCL. We validated these clusters by smFISH imaging (Fig.\u00a04d, Extended Data Figs.\u00a09, 10).Finally, we analysed ligand\u2013receptor pairs that are enriched in neighbouring cells\u2014information that is not available in a\u00a0dissociated-cell analysis. These potential cell\u2013cell interactions are proposed on the basis of mRNA and not protein. Endothelial cells adjacent to microglia in the olfactory bulb express endoglin (Eng, a type III TGF\u03b2 receptor) and activin A receptor (Acvrl1 (also known as Alk1), a type I TGF\u03b2 receptor) mRNAs, and the microglia express TGF\u03b2 ligand (Tgfb1) mRNA. By contrast, endothelial cells adjacent to microglia in the cortex express Lrp1 (also known as Tgfbr5) and Pdgfb, indicating that signalling pathways may be used in a tissue-specific fashion. Beyond ligand\u2013receptor interactions, we found broadly that gene expression patterns in a particular cell type are highly dependent on the local tissue context of neighbouring cells (Fig.\u00a04e, f, Supplementary Table\u00a04).These experiments demonstrate that seqFISH+ can robustly profile transcriptomes in tissues, overcoming optical crowding and removing the last conceptual roadblock in generating spatial single-cell atlases in tissues. seqFISH+ provides a\u00a0tenfold or\u00a0greater improvement over existing methods in the number of mRNAs profiled and the total number of RNA barcodes detected per cell. seqFISH+ also enables super-resolved imaging with commercial confocal microscopes and can be generalized to chromosome30 and protein imaging.With the genome coverage and spatial resolution of seqFISH+, it is now possible to perform discovery-driven studies directly in situ. In particular, elucidating signalling interactions between cells is a crucial first step towards understanding developmental processes and cell-fate decisions, along with explorations of the combinatorial signalling logic21. Finally, the genomics coverage of seqFISH+ will enable the\u00a0discovery of targets that are cell-type specific in disease samples, as well as enabling precise spatial genomics and single-cell-based diagnostics testing.MethodsData reportingNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and\u00a0outcome assessment.Experiment designPrimary-probe designGene-specific primary probes were designed as previously described with some modifications8. To obtain probe sets for 10,000 different genes, 28-nucleotide (nt) sequences of each gene were extracted, first using the exons from within the coding region. For genes that did not yield enough target sequences from the coding region, exons from both the coding and untranslated regions were used. The masked genome and annotation from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) were used to look up the gene sequences. Probe sequences were required to have GC content within the range 45\u201365%. Any probe sequences that contained five or more consecutive bases of the same kind were dropped. Any genes that did not achieve a minimum number of 24 probes were dropped. A local BLAST query was run on each probe against the mouse transcriptome to ensure specificity. BLAST hits on any sequences other than the target gene with a 15-nt match were considered off targets. ENCODE RNA-seq data across different mouse samples were used to generate an off-target copy-number table. Any probe that hit an expected total off-target copy number exceeding 10,000 FPKM was dropped to remove housekeeping genes, ribosomal genes and very highly expressed genes. To minimize cross-hybridization between probe sets, a local BLAST database was constructed from the probe sequences, and probes with hits of 17\u00a0nt or longer were removed by dropping the matched probe from the larger probe set.Readout-probe designReadout probes of\u00a015\u00a0nt in length were designed as previously described9. In brief, a set of probe sequences was randomly generated with combinations of A, T, G or C nucleotides. Readout-probe sequences within a GC-content range of 40\u201360% were selected. We performed a BLAST search against the mouse transcriptome to ensure the specificity of the readout probes. To minimize cross-hybridization of the readout probes, any probes with ten contiguously matching sequences between readout probes were removed. The reverse complements of these readout-probe sequences were included in the primary probes according to the designed barcodes.Primary-probe constructionPrimary probes were ordered as oligoarray complex pools from Twist Bioscience and were constructed as previously described with some modifications8. In brief, limited PCR cycles were used to amplify the designated probe sequences from the oligo complex pool. Then, the amplified PCR products were purified using\u00a0the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (28104; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The PCR products were used as the template for in vitro transcription (E2040S; NEB) followed by reverse transcription (EP7051; Thermo Fisher) with the forward primer containing a uracil nucleotide31. After reverse transcription, the probes were subjected to a\u00a01:30 dilution of uracil-specific excision reagent (USER) enzyme (N5505S; NEB) treatment to remove the forward primer by cleaving off the uracil nucleotide next to it for ~24 h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Since the reverse complement of T7 sequences was used as the reverse primer, the final probe length in this probe set was ~93\u00a0nt. Then, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were alkaline hydrolysed with 1 M NaOH at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 15 min to degrade the RNA templates, followed by 1 M acetic acid neutralization. Next, to clean up the probes, we performed ethanol precipitation to remove stray nucleotides, phenol\u2013chloroform extraction to remove protein, and used Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (7K MWCO) (89882; Thermo Fisher) to remove any residual nucleotides and phenol contaminants. Then, the probes were mixed with 2 \u03bcM of locked nucleic acid (LNA) polyT15 and 2 \u03bcM of LNA polyT30 before drying by speed-vac to powder, and resuspended in primary-probe hybridization buffer comprising 40% formamide (F9027, Sigma), 2\u00d7 SSC (15557036, Thermo Fisher) and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (D8906; Sigma). The probes were stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C until use.Readout-probe synthesisReadout probes of\u00a015\u00a0nt in length were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies as 5\u2032-amine modified. The construction of readout probes was similar to that previously described9. In brief, 5 nmol DNA probes was mixed with 25 \u03bcg of Alexa Fluor 647\u2013NHS ester or Cy3B or Alexa Fluor 488\u2013NHS ester in 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate buffer containing 10% dimethyl fumarate. The reaction was allowed to go on\u00a0for at least 6 h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Then, the DNA probes were subjected to ethanol precipitation, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification and column purification to remove all contaminants. Once resuspended in water, the readout probes were quantified using Nanodrop and a 500 nM working stock was made. All the readout probes were stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C.Coverslip functionalizationFor cell culture experiments, coverslips were cleaned with a plasma cleaner on a high setting (PDC-001, Harrick Plasma) for 5 min, followed by immersion in 1% bind-silane solution (GE; 17-1330-01) made in pH\u00a03.5 10% (v/v) acidic ethanol solution for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the coverslips were rinsed with 100% ethanol three times, and heat-dried in an oven at >90\u2009\u00b0C for 30 min. Next, the coverslips were treated with 100 \u03bcg\u00a0\u03bcl\u22121 of poly-d-lysine (P6407; Sigma) in water for >1 h at room temperature, followed by three rinses with water. The coverslips were then air-dried and kept at 4\u2009\u00b0C for no longer than 2 weeks. For mouse brain-slice experiments, coverslips were cleaned with 1\u00a0M HCl at room temperature for 1 h, rinsed with water once, and treated with 1\u00a0M NaOH solution at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the coverslips were rinsed three times with water, before immersion in 1% bind-silane solution for 1 h at room temperature. The remaining steps were the same as the coverslip functionalization for cell culture.seqFISH+ encoding strategyWe separated the 60 pseudocolours into three fluorescent channels (Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3b and Alexa Fluor 647) equally. In each channel, the 20-pseudocolour imaging was repeated three times, hence achieving 203 (that is, 8,000) genes barcoding capacity. We performed an extra round of pseudocolour imaging to obtain error-correctable barcodes, an error-correction scheme that we had previously introduced3. Thus, we obtained 8,000 error-correctable barcodes in three fluorescent channels\u2014a\u00a024,000 error-correctable barcoding capacity in total. More fluorescent channels and/or more pseudocolours can be added easily to achieve greater dilution of the mRNA density per imaging round. In this experiment, we encoded 3,333, 3,333 and 3,334 genes in each of the fluorescent channels. This pseudocolour scheme evolved from the one used in RNA sequential probing of targets (RNA\u00a0SPOTs)8 and intron seqFISH9, by eliminating chromatic aberration and drastically diluting the density to achieve profiling of mRNA at the transcriptome level in situ.To visualize the different transcripts, 24 \u2018primary\u2019 probes were designed against each target mRNA. The primary probes contain overhang sequences that code for the four-unit base-20 barcode unique to each gene. Hybridization with fluorophore-labelled readout probes allows the readout of these barcodes and fluorescently labels the subset of genes that contain the corresponding sequences. All of the genes are sampled every 20 rounds of readout hybridization and collapsed into super-resolved images. A total of 80 rounds of hybridizations enumerate the four-unit barcode for each gene. Each round of stripping and readout hybridization is fast and is\u00a0completed in minutes.After hybridization\u00a0of primary probes, the samples were subjected to hydrogel embedding and clearing before seqFISH+ imaging. The details are available in\u00a0the \u2018Cell culture experiment\u2019,\u00a0\u2018Tissue slices experiment\u2019 and \u2018seqFISH+ imaging\u2019 sections below.Cell culture experimentNIH/3T3 cells (ATCC) were cultured as previously described8 on the functionalized coverslips to ~80\u201390% confluence. Then, the cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS once\u00a0and fixed with freshly made 4% formaldehyde (28906; Thermo Fisher) in 1\u00d7 PBS (AM9624, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 70% ethanol for 1 h at room temperature. The cell samples were dried and the 10,000 gene probes (~1 nM per probe for 24 probes per gene) were hybridized by spreading out using another coverslip. The hybridization was allowed to proceed for ~36\u201348 h in a humid chamber at 37\u2009\u00b0C. We found hybridization for 48 h yielded slightly brighter signals. After hybridization, the samples were washed with 40% formamide in 2\u00d7 SSC at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by three rinses with 1 ml 2\u00d7 SSC. Next, the cell samples were incubated with a\u00a01:1,000 dilution of Tetraspeck beads in 2\u00d7 SSC at room temperature for 5\u201310 min. The density of the beads could be easily adjusted by varying the dilution factor or incubation time. Then, the samples were rinsed with 2\u00d7 SSC and incubated with degassed 4% acrylamide (1610154; Bio-Rad) solution in 2\u00d7 SSC for 5 min at room temperature. To initiate polymerization, the 4% acrylamide solution was aspirated, then 10 \u03bcl of 4% hydrogel solution containing 4% acrylamide (1:19), 2\u00d7 SSC, 0.2% ammonium persulfate (APS) (A3078; Sigma) and 0.2% N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) (T7024; Sigma) was dropped on the sample, and sandwiched by a coverslip functionalized by GelSlick (Lonza; 50640). The polymerization step was allowed to occur at room temperature for 1 h in a home-made nitrogen gas chamber. After that, the two coverslips were gently separated, and the excess gel was cut away with a razor. A custom-made flow cell (RD478685-M; Grace Bio-Labs) was attached to the coverslips covering the region of cells embedded in hydrogel. The hydrogel-embedded cell samples were cleared as previously described for >1 h at 37\u2009\u00b0C19. The digestion buffer consisted of 1:100 proteinase K (P8107S; NEB), 50 mM pH 8 Tris HCl (AM9856; Invitrogen), 1 mM EDTA (15575020; Invitrogen), 0.5% Triton-X 100 and 500 mM NaCl (S5150, Sigma). Then, the samples were rinsed with 2\u00d7 SSC multiple times and subjected to Label-IT modification (1:10) (MIR 3900; Mirus Bio) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30 min. After that, the cell samples were post-fixed with 4% PFA in 1\u00d7 PBS to stabilize the DNA, RNA and the overall cell sample for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by 1 M pH\u00a08.0 Tris HCl at room temperature for 10 min. The cell samples were either imaged immediately or kept in 4\u00d7 SSC supplemented with 2 U\u00a0\u03bcl\u22121 of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor (AM2696; Invitrogen) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for no longer than 6 h.MiceAll animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance with Caltech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and NIH guidelines. Wild-type mice C57BL/6J of\u00a0post-natal day (P)23 (male) and P40 (male) were used for the cortex and olfactory bulb seqFISH+ experiments, respectively. For smFISH experiments, adult wild-type mice C57BL/6J aged 10 weeks (female) were used for the RNA localization experiment in the cortex and ligand\u2013receptor interaction experiment in the olfactory bulb. For cell cluster validation in the olfactory bulb, a section from P40 mice was used.Tissue slices experimentBrain extraction was performed as previously described3. In brief, mice were perfused for 8 min with perfusion buffer (10 U\u00a0ml\u22121 heparin, 0.5% NaNO2 (w/v) in 0.1 M PBS at 4\u2009\u00b0C). Mice were then perfused with fresh 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS buffer at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 8 min. The mouse brain was removed from the skull and immediately placed in a 4% PFA buffer for 2 h at room temperature under gentle mixing. The brain was then immersed in 4\u2009\u00b0C 30% RNase-free sucrose (Amresco 0335) in 1\u00d7 PBS until the brain sank. After the brain sank, the brain was frozen in a dry ice\u2013isopropanol bath in OCT medium and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Five-micrometre sections were cut using a cryotome and immediately placed on the functionalized coverslips. The thin tissue slices were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. To perform hybridization on the tissue slices, the tissue slices were first permeabilized in 70% ethanol at 4\u2009\u00b0C for >1 h. Then, the tissue slices were cleared with 8% SDS (AM9822; Invitrogen) in 1\u00d7 PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary probes were hybridized to the tissue slices by spreading out the hybridization buffer solution with a coverslip. The hybridization was allowed to proceed for ~60 h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After primary probe hybridization, the tissue slices were washed with 40% formamide at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30 min. After rinsing with 2\u00d7 SSC three times and 1\u00d7 PBS once, the sample was subjected to treatment with 0.1\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121 Acryoloyl-X succinimidyl ester (A20770; Thermo Fisher) in 1\u00d7 PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the tissue slices were incubated with 4% acrylamide (1:19 crosslinking) hydrogel solution in 2\u00d7 SSC for 30 min at room temperature. The hydrogel solution was aspirated and 20 \u03bcl of 4% hydrogel solution containing 0.05% APS and 0.05% TEMED in 2\u00d7 SSC was dropped onto the tissue slice and sandwiched by Gel-Slick functionalized slides. The samples were transferred to 4\u2009\u00b0C in a home-made nitrogen gas chamber for 30 min before transferring to 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2.5 h to complete polymerization. After polymerization, the hydrogel-embedded tissue slices were cleared with digestion buffer as mentioned above, except that\u00a0it included 1% SDS, for >3 h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After digestion, the tissue slices were rinsed with 2\u00d7 SSC multiple times and subjected to 0.1\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121 label-X modification19 for 45 min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The preparation of label-X stock was as previously described19. To further stabilize the DNA probes, RNA molecules, and the overall structure\u00a0of the tissue slices, the tissue slices were re-embedded in hydrogel solution as in the previous step, except that\u00a0the gelation time could be shortened to 2 h. The tissue slice samples were either imaged immediately or kept in 4\u00d7 SSC supplemented with 2 U\u00a0\u03bcl\u22121 of SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor at 4\u2009\u00b0C for no longer than 6 h.seqFISH+ imagingThe imaging platform and automated fluidics delivery system were similar to those previously described9 with some modifications. In brief, the flow cell on the sample was first connected to the automated fluidics system. Then the region of interest (ROI) was registered using nuclei signals stained with 10 \u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 DAPI (D8417; Sigma). For cell culture experiments, blank images containing beads only were first imaged before the first round of serial hybridization. Each serial hybridization buffer contained three unique sequences with different concentrations of 15-nt readouts conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 647\u00a0(50 nM), Cy3B\u00a0(50 nM) or Alexa Fluor 488\u00a0(100 nM) in EC buffer (10% ethylene carbonate (E26258; Sigma), 10% dextran sulfate (D4911; Sigma), 4\u00d7 SSC and 1:100 dilution of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor). The 100 \u03bcl of serial hybridization buffers for 80 rounds of seqFISH+ imaging with a repeat for round 1 (in total 81 rounds) was pipetted into a 96-well\u00a0plate. During each serial hybridization, the automated sampler moves to the well of the designated hybridization buffer and moves the 100 \u03bcl hybridization buffer through a multichannel fluidic valve (EZ1213-820-4; IDEX Health & Science) to the flow cell (requires ~25 \u03bcl) using a syringe pump (63133-01, Hamilton Company). The serial hybridization solution was incubated for 17 min for cell culture experiments and 20 min for tissue slice experiments at room temperature. After serial hybridization, the sample was washed with ~300 \u03bcl of 10% formamide wash buffer (10% formamide and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 2\u00d7 SSC) to remove excess readout probes and non-specific binding. Then, the sample was rinsed with ~200 \u03bcl of 4\u00d7 SSC supplemented with a\u00a01:1,000 dilution of SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor, before\u00a0being stained with DAPI solution (10 \u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 of DAPI, 4\u00d7 SSC, and\u00a0a 1:1,000 dilution of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor) for ~15 s. Next, an anti-bleaching buffer solution made of 10% (w/v) glucose, 1:100 diluted catalase (Sigma C3155), 0.5 mg\u00a0ml\u22121 glucose oxidase (Sigma G2133), 0.02 U\u00a0\u03bcl\u22121 SUPERase In RNase inhibitor\u00a0and 50 mM pH\u00a08 Tris-HCl in 4\u00d7 SSC was flowed through the samples. Imaging was done with a microscope (Leica DMi8) equipped with a confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa CSU-W1), a sCMOS camera (Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus), a\u00a063\u00d7\u00a0oil objective lens (Leica 1.40 NA) and a motorized stage (ASI MS2000). Lasers from CNI and filter sets from Semrock were used. Snapshots were acquired with 0.35-\u03bcm z-steps for two z-slices per FOV across 647-nm, 561-nm, 488-nm and 405-nm fluorescent channels. After imaging, stripping buffer (55% formamide and 0.1% Triton-X 100 in 2\u00d7 SSC) was flowed through for 1 min, followed by an incubation time of 1 min before rinsing with 4\u00d7 SSC solution. In general, the 15-nt readouts were stripped off within seconds, and a 2-min wash ensured the removal of any residual signal. The serial hybridization, imaging and signal extinguishing steps were repeated for 80 rounds. Then, staining buffer for segmentation (10 \u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 DAPI, 50\u00a0nM LNA T20-Alexa Fluor 647 and\u00a0a 1:100 dilution of Nissl stain (N21480; Invitrogen)) in 1\u00d7 PBS was flowed in and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature before imaging. The integration of automated fluidics delivery system and imaging was controlled by a custom written script in \u03bcManager32.smFISHsmFISH experiments were performed as previously described8. In brief, 60 genes were randomly chosen from the 10,000 gene list across a broad range of expression levels. The same probe sequences were used for these 60 genes, except each primary probe contained two binding sites of the readout probes. The fixed cells were hybridized with the primary probes (10\u00a0nM per probe) in 40% hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate and 2\u00d7 SSC) at 37\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The sample was washed with 40% wash buffer for 30 min at 37\u2009\u00b0C and subjected to the same hydrogel embedding and clearing as the cell culture experiment before imaging. The imaging platform was the same as the one in\u00a0the seqFISH+ experiment. A single z-slice across hundreds of cells was imaged and the sum of the gene counts per cell was analysed using a custom written Matlab script. For smFISH experiments in the tissue, the sample was hybridized with 10\u00a0nM per probe in 40% hybridization buffer at 37\u2009\u00b0C for >16 h. The sample was washed with 40% wash buffer for 30 min at 37\u2009\u00b0C and subjected to the same hydrogel embedding and clearing as the tissue experiment before imaging. As the imaging time is short, the Acryoloyl-X functionalization and post-hydrogel anchoring steps were omitted. Five z-slices with z-steps of 1\u00a0\u03bcm were taken across multiple FOVs with the imaging platform as in the seqFISH+ experiment, except that\u00a0a 40\u00d7 oil objective was used (Leica 1.40 NA). Images were background subtracted and maximum z-projected for clearer display of RNA dots.Image analysisAll image analysis was performed in Matlab. Unless a specific Matlab function is referenced, custom code was used.Image registrationEach round of imaging included imaging with the 405-nm channel, which included the DAPI stain of the cell along with imaging in the 647-nm, 561-nm and 488-nm channels of TetraSpeck beads (T7279, Thermo Fisher) and seqFISH+ probes. In addition, a pre-hybridization image was used to find all beads before the readouts were hybridized. Bead locations were fit to a 2D Gaussian function. An initial estimate of the transformation matrix between the DAPI image for each serial hybridization round and the beads-only image was found using imregcorr (Matlab). Using this estimate transformation, the bead coordinates were transformed to each serial hybridization image, where the location of the bead was again fit to a 2D Gaussian function. A final transformation matrix between each hybridization image and the beads-only image was then found by applying fitgeotrans (Matlab) to the sets of Gaussian fit bead locations. For the tissue samples, no beads were used and registration was based on DAPI alone.Image processingEach image was deconvolved, using a bead (7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 pixels) as an estimate for the point spread function. Cell segmentation was performed manually usingthe ROI tool in ImageJ.Barcode callingThe potential RNA signals were then found by finding local maxima in the image above with a predetermined pixel threshold in the registered and deconvolved images. Dot locations were then further resolved using radialcentre.m33. Once all potential points in all serial hybridizations of one fluorescent channel were obtained, they were organized by pseudocolour and barcoding round. Dots were matched to potential barcode partners in all other pseudo channels of all other barcoding rounds using a 1-pixel search radius (or, for the tissue samples, a 1.4-pixel search radius) to find symmetric nearest neighbours. Point combinations that constructed only a single barcode were immediately matched to the on-target barcode set. For point\u00a0combinations that matched to construct multiple barcodes, the point sets were first filtered by calculating the residual spatial distance of each potential barcode point set, and only the point sets giving the minimum residuals were used to match to a barcode. If multiple barcodes were still possible, the point was matched to its closest on-target barcode with a Hamming distance of 1. If multiple on-target barcodes were still possible, then the point was dropped from the analysis as an ambiguous barcode. This procedure was repeated using each barcoding round as a seed for barcode finding and only barcodes that were called similarly in at least 3 out of 4 rounds were used in the analysis. The number of each barcode was then counted in each of the assigned cell areas and transcript numbers were assigned on the basis of the number of on-target barcodes present in the cell. Centroids for each called barcode were also recorded and assigned to cells. The same procedure was repeated for 647-nm, 561-nm and 488-nm channels. The remaining unused barcodes were used as an off-target evaluation by repeating the same procedure as described.Data analysisRNA-seq and RNA SPOTsPearson\u2019s R correlation was performed to compare seqFISH+ data to RNA-seq (Gene Expression Omnibus\u00a0(GEO) accession number GSE98674), RNA SPOTs8 and smFISH measurement using Matlab or Python functions.Spatial clustering of genes for NIH/3T3 cellsThe same barcode-calling procedure described above was repeated without cell segmentation to remove the possibility of clipping potentially interesting regions of the cell. RNA locations were coarse grained to 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 pixels, resulting in a matrix of dimensions of the\u00a0total number of coarse-grained pixels by the number of genes. Coarse pixels with no RNA were removed from the analysis. RNA with fewer than ten copies per FOV were dropped. Genes were then correlated with Pearson\u2019s R correlation and hierarchical clustering was performed on the resulting correlation matrix. Clusters of less than ten genes were dropped.Hierarchical clustering of brain seqFISH+ dataThe 10,000 genes were divided into three approximately equal subsets (with 3,334, 3,333 and 3,333 genes, respectively) on the basis of the group in which genes were barcoded. Genes were normalized separately within each subset, by dividing the gene counts per cell by the total counts per cell within each subset. We then multiplied the result by the scaling factor 2,000, which is approximately the median count. Next, we selected the subset of cells that were in the cortex. We computed log(1\u00a0+\u00a0normalized counts).To select genes for clustering, we first computed statistics for the following criteria for each gene: (1) number of cells with non-zero expression; (2) average gene expression of all cells; (3) average expression of top 5% of cells with highest expression; (4) average of top 10% of cells with highest expression; (5) average of top 2% of cells with highest expression; and (6) average gene expression of all non-zero cells. For each criterion, we selected the top 25% of genes that were ranked based on the criterion. We next obtained the union of all six gene lists, forming an initial 3,877-gene set. The reasoning is that the union of genes would contain genes needed to cluster both common cell types (which would be expressed in a large population of cells, captured by criterion 2) and rare cell types (which would be expressed in a small population, captured by criteria 3, 4 and 5). The 3,877-gene expression-data matrix was next transformed by z-scoring per cell and per gene. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed and jackstraw procedure was adopted to further select the most relevant genes for clustering. Specifically, the jackstraw procedure34 permutes the expression of a small number of genes to identify significant genes (that is, genes\u00a0with significantly higher loading than\u00a0the permuted case (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001)). Using the top nine components, we found a total of 1,916 significant genes to be used for final clustering.To this 1,916-gene matrix we applied hierarchical clustering with Ward's linkage and with (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Pearson correlation) as the distance measure. Using the sigClust R package35, which evaluates the significance of each branching in the dendrogram, we found significant tree splits and produced 10-cluster and 16-cluster annotations corresponding to different cluster granularity. Each split was significant according to sigClust FWER corrected P\u00a0<\u00a00.05. We further performed an additional round of clustering within the interneuron annotated clusters, repeated\u00a0the gene-selection procedure and replaced the broad interneuron cluster with the subclusters. All together, we derived 13-cluster and 18-cluster annotations.Unsupervised comparison with scRNA-seq dataMouse visual cortex scRNA-seq data were obtained from ref. 25. We used the cell-type annotations from the original study, representing 9 major, 22 fine and 49 minor cell types. For comparison, we focused on the 1,857 genes that were commonly profiled by scRNA-seq and seqFISH+, and we\u00a0processed the scRNA-seq data in the same way as\u00a0for seqFISH+. The degree of similarity was evaluated by using the Pearson correlation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c).Supervised mapping of cell types from scRNA-seq to seqFISH+Cell-type mapping was performed as described14. In brief, MAST36 was used to identify differentially expressed genes across annotated cell types from the scRNA-seq dataset in ref. 25, using P\u00a0=\u00a00.005 as the cut-off. A total of 1,253 of the differentially expressed genes were also profiled by seqFISH+, and therefore were retained for cell-type mapping. Then, we performed a quantile\u00a0normalization on the expression vectors of each gene in both the seqFISH+ and scRNA-seq data to normalize cross-platform differences14. Multi-class support-vector machine models were trained on the scRNA-seq cell types using linear kernels, and the tuning parameter C was set\u00a0to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04d). The cross-validation accuracy of prediction of the 22 annotated cell types was 91% with these 1,253 differentially expressed genes.Spatial gene identificationIn brief, we computed a spatial score per gene, as previously described14. Cells were divided into two sets based on the basis of each gene: L1 contains cells with highest 90th percentile by expression, and L0 contains the remaining cells. The spatial score measures whether the cells in L1 are spatially adjacent to each other, and is quantified by the silhouette coefficient. The silhouette coefficient was computed using the calc_silhouette_per_gene() function in the smfish Hmrf Python package14 (https://bitbucket.org/qzhudfci/smfishhmrf-py), setting the\u00a0dissimilarity matrix to rank-transformed Euclidean distance, examine_top\u00a0=\u00a00.1, permutation_test\u00a0=\u00a0True, and permutations\u00a0=\u00a01,000. Rank-transformed distance was computed with rank_transform_matrix() function with reverse\u00a0=\u00a0False, rbp_P\u00a0=\u00a00.99 where rbp_P is a rank-weighting parameter. We selected all spatial genes with a\u00a0significant silhouette coefficient (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 permutation test). To further enrich for spatial signals within these genes, we performed a PCA analysis, and then the jackstraw procedure34, to arrive at a set of 988 spatial genes that were\u00a0significantly correlated to the principle components. We performed HMRF analysis on the top 100, 200 and\u00a0400 of the\u00a0988 genes.Spatial domain identification via HMRF procedureHMRF is a probabilistic spatial-clustering method that we developed previously to identify spatial domains on the basis of spatial relationships and gene expression per cell. We constructed a neighbourhood graph by adopting a fixed radius corresponding to the top percentile of pairwise physical distances between cells, resulting in an average of five neighbours per cell. HMRF was run with the following parameters: tolerance\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210, k\u00a0=\u00a09, and convergence_error\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128. To search for an optimal value of beta, we scanned through all integer values between 2 and 100 and ran the HMRF model for each setting. The value that resulted in minimal change of log likelihood was selected as the final beta.Louvain clusteringUnless specified, all functions of pre-processing and Louvain clustering were performed in Python using the package SCANPY37. We followed a standard procedure as suggested in the SCANPY reimplementation of Seurat\u2019s tutorial to analyse seqFISH+ data, with some modifications. For clustering all cells from mouse cortex, subventricular zone (SVZ), choroid plexus and olfactory bulb, we first normalized the counts per cell, then chose highly variable genes with >0.4 min_dispersion\u00a0and 0.01 min_mean, with max_mean\u00a0=\u00a03. This yielded 3,509 genes. Then we took the logarithm of the data, regressed out the total count effect per cell and scaled the data to unit variance. We computed the PCAs and used the top principal components to compute the neighbourhood graph, before performing Louvain clustering. We used the rank_gene_groups function with raw data, and the top 20\u00a0enriched genes in each cluster were used to identify the clusters on the basis of marker gene annotation from scRNA-seq or DropSeq data29,38. We found that both hierarchical clustering and Louvain clustering yielded similar results despite using\u00a0different methods.To spatially map back the clusters on the raw image, we performed Louvain clustering on cortex, SVZ and choroid plexus data, and olfactory bulb data separately. Genes with max count greater than four across all cells were chosen for cortex and SVZ (include choroid plexus cells) data. Next, we filtered out cells with less than 200 genes expressed from\u00a0the analysis. The counts were normalized per cell and a minimum dispersion of greater than 0 with min_mean of 0.05 was chosen to filter out the variable genes. This yielded 1,813 genes for subsequent analysis. For the olfactory bulb, genes with max count greater than two across all cells were first chosen. Then the counts were normalized per cell. To obtain the highly variable genes, a threshold of min_mean\u00a0of\u00a00.05 and min_dispersion of 0.2 was chosen. This yields 1,972 genes for subsequent analysis. After choosing the highly variable genes, the data were subjected to PCA reduction, computed neighbourhood graph with top PCs, and Louvain clustering. The top 20 enrichment genes were obtained using rank_genes_groups function and the clusters were identified according to published literature. Sub-clustering of the main cluster was performed by repeating the process described above. The visualization of these clusters to two dimensions using UMAP was done with the SCANPY function. These cluster numbers were mapped back to the original data to visualize the spatial heterogeneity of different cell types across different parts of the tissues.Calculation of the time acceleration of seqFISH+ versus seqFISH-expansionFor seqFISH-expansion, we assume that to code ~20,000 genes, the coding scheme uses four colours and eight rounds of hybridization (47\u00a0=\u00a016,384 genes) with one round of error correction. Thus, the total number of effective imaging per FOV is equal to the expansion factor\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08. For 60-fold expansion, this is 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0=\u00a01,920 images. For seqFISH+, we assume a coding scheme with three separate fluorescent channels, with 8,000 genes coded in each channel for a total of 24,000 genes. Pseudocolours are used to code for 8,000 genes. For example, if the number of pseudocolours is 20 per fluorescent channel, then four rounds of barcoding (including one round of error correction) are needed. The effective imaging per FOV is then 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0=\u00a0240 images\u2014an eightfold acceleration compared to seqFISH-expansion. As another example, if the pseudocolour per channel is ten, then five rounds of barcoding are needed to cover 8,000 genes per channel. Then, there is a total of 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0=\u00a0150 images. However, this coding scheme only provides a 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0= 30-fold decrease in the RNA density. If an equivalent of 30-fold expansion was implemented, then 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0=\u00a0960 images are needed per FOV for an acceleration rate of 960/150\u00a0=\u00a06.4 fold.Bootstrap analysisWe calculated the cell-to-cell correlation matrix with the number of genes downsampled from the 2,511 genes that expressed at least 5 copies in a cell. For each downsampled dataset, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 genes were selected randomly. The Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of each of the cell-to-cell correlation matrices was computed with the cell-to-cell correlation matrix for the 2,511-gene dataset. Five trials were simulated for each downsampled gene level. Error bars denote standard deviation.Neighbour-cell analysisThe spatial coordinates for the cell centroids were used to create a nearest-neighbour network (k\u00a0=\u00a04), in which nodes represent individual cells and edges are observed proximities between two cells. Edges between identical or different annotated cell types were labelled as homo- or heterotypic, respectively. To identify enriched or depleted proximities between two identical or different cell types, the observed number of edges between any two cell types was compared to a random permutation (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) distribution by reshuffling the cell labels. Associated P values were calculated by observing how often the simulated values were higher or lower than the observed value for respectively enriched or depleted proximities.Gene expression enrichment for cell types in close proximity was calculated as the average expression for that gene in all the cells of the two cell types that were in close proximity according to the spatial network. The number of observed edges between two cell types and\u00a0the z-scores for each gene were further used to filter and identify enriched gene expression in any combination of two proximal cell types.To determine the ligand\u2013receptor pairs in neighbouring cells, we extracted genes that had z-scores of 1 or higher, were expressed in at least 25% of the cells in the interacting pairs, and had at least 4 instances of being neighbours. We then matched up the ligand\u2013receptor pairs from the literature39, as\u00a0shown in Supplementary Table\u00a04. To identify statistically enriched ligand\u2013receptor pairs, we compared the calculated ligand\u2013receptor scores with that of a random permutation (n\u00a0=\u00a01,000) distribution by reshuffling the cell labels. P\u00a0<0.05 was deemed to be significant.RNA localization analysisTo determine the subcellular localization patterns of mRNAs in the cortex, all cells were first separated into 26-cell clusters (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Within each cell class, the top 200 highly expressed genes were selected for localization analysis. In each cell, the average distance of all of the transcripts for each of the 200 genes from the centre of the mass of all of the transcripts for all of\u00a0the genes was calculated. This metric corresponds to whether the gene is likely to be found close to or far from the cell centre. Only cells with four or more copies of that RNA were included in the calculation. The average distance from the centre for each cell was normalized by the size of the cell\u2014determined as the square root of the area spanned by the convex hull of all the mRNA dots in that cell. To select the genes that were localized far from the centre of the cell, a threshold of 0.45 for the localization score was used and the average expression level was set at greater than 2.5 copies detected per cell. We selected genes that were close to the cell centre using a localization score of 0.35 or lower and an expression level of greater than 2.5 copies per cell. The results are shown in Supplementary Table\u00a03.Contact mapsThe minimum distances between the pixels defining the edge of all pairs of cells in a FOV were tabulated. To count the number of times cells of each type were in contact with cells of each other type, the following procedure was followed. Cells within 15 pixels of a given cell were considered\u00a0as being in contact, and the appropriate entry in a square matrix of length equal to the number of cell types was incremented. The counts were then normalized such that each row sums to 1. Hierarchical clustering was then performed to cluster cell types.Step-by-step protocolA detailed protocol for RNA seqFISH+ sample preparation is available at the Protocol Exchange40.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.Code availabilityThe custom written scripts used in this study are available at https://github.com/CaiGroup/seqFISH-PLUS.\n\n\nData availability\nRNA-seq data were obtained from GEO\u00a0accession number GSE98674.

A marked decrease in background is observed in the\u00a0cleared sample. The image was acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope. b, In each round of hybridization for the 10,000-gene experiment, diffraction-limited dots are clearly separated, indicating that the pseudocolour scheme effectively dilutes the density of the sample. The signal is completely removed between different rounds of hybridization, with no \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the pseudocolours. Stripping is accomplished by\u00a0a 55% formamide wash, which is highly efficient. c, After the completion of each seqFISH+ experiment, the\u00a0readout probes used in hybridization 1 are rehybridized in round 81. The colocalization rates between rounds 1 and 81 are 76% (647-nm channel), 73% (561-nm channel) and 80% (488-nm channel) within a two-pixel radius. The colocalization between the two images indicates that most of the primary probes remain bound through 80 rounds of hybridization and imaging, although some loss of RNA and signal is seen across 80 rounds of hybridization (n\u00a0=\u00a0227 cells).Extended Data Fig. 3 seqFISH+ works efficiently across all three fluorescent channels and identifies localization patterns of transcripts in NIH/3T3 cells.a, Correlation plots between seqFISH+ and bulk RNA-seq in three fluorescent channels. Barcodes are coded entirely within each channel, with n\u00a0=\u00a03,334, 3,333 and 3,333 barcodes in each channel, respectively. Barcodes in all channels are decoded and called out efficiently. b, seqFISH+ result correlates strongly with RNA SPOTs measurement in NIH/3T3 cells. SPM, spots per million. c, Correlation between seqFISH+ and smFISH for each fluorescent channel (from left to right, n\u00a0=\u00a024, 18 and 18 genes). All correlations were computed by Pearson\u2019s R coefficient correlation, with two-tailed P values reported. d, The callout frequency of on-target 10,000 barcodes versus the remaining 14,000 off-target barcodes. Off-target barcodes are called out at a rate of 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) per barcode. e, Histogram of the total number of mRNAs detected per NIH/3T3 cell. On average, 35,492\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012,222 transcripts are detected per cell. f, Genes are clustered on the basis of co-occurrence in a 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-pixel window. Three major clusters are nuclear\u2013perinuclear, cytoplasmic and protrusions. g, mRNAs show preferential spatial localization patterns: nuclear, cytoplasm and protrusions (n\u00a0=\u00a0227 cells). The image is binned into 1\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm windows and coloured on the basis of the genes enriched in each bin (scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm). h, Examples of genes enriched in each spatial cluster. i, Genes in the subclusters within the nuclear-localized group. Subcluster 1 contains genes that encode for extracellular matrix proteins. Genes in subcluster 2 are involved in the\u00a0actin cytoskeleton, whereas genes\u00a0in subcluster 3 are involved in microtubule networks. j, Representative smFISH image (single z-slice) of three genes in subcluster 1 shows nuclear\u2013perinuclear localization (n\u00a0=\u00a020 FOVs, 40\u00d7 objective). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm.Extended Data Fig. 4 scRNA-seq comparison with seqFISH+, bootstrap and HMRF analysis.a, b, Histogram of the number of genes (a) and total RNA barcodes (b) detected per cell by seqFISH+ in the cortex. c, Unsupervised clustering of seqFISH+ correlates well with scRNA-seq (n\u00a0=\u00a01,857 genes; Pearson\u2019s R coefficient correlation)25. d, Supervised mapping of seqFISH+-analysed cortex cell clusters with those from scRNA-seq clusters (n\u00a0=\u00a01,253 genes; P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). e, The number of genes was downsampled from the 2,511 genes that expressed at least five copies in a cell. For each downsampled dataset, the cell-to-cell correlation matrix is calculated and correlated with the cell-to-cell correlation matrix for the 2,511-gene dataset. Five trials are simulated for each downsampled gene level. Data are mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d. Even when downsampled to 100 genes, about 40% of the cell-to-cell correlation is retained, because the expression patterns of many genes are correlated. f, Scatter plots of seqFISH+ with scRNA-seq in different cell types. Each dot represents a gene and its mean expression z-score value in either seqFISH+ or scRNA-seq, in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and excitatory neurons. In general, seqFISH+ and scRNA-seq are in good agreement (n\u00a0=\u00a0598 genes each). g, HMRF detects spatial domains that contain cells with similar expression patterns regardless of cell type. Domain-specific genes are shown. h, Spatial domains in the cortex. i, Mapping of the hierarchical clusters onto the cortex. Coordinates are in units of one pixel (103\u00a0nm per pixel). Each camera FOV is 2,000 pixels.Extended Data Fig. 5 Differential gene expressions between cell-type clusters.a, b,\u00a0Expression measured by seqFISH+ (a) and scRNA-seq (b). The expression patterns of seqFISH+ clusters are similar to those shown by scRNA-seq clusters (n\u00a0=\u00a0143 genes).Extended Data Fig. 6 Comparison of the spatial expression patterns across the cortex.a, b, seqFISH+ data (a) versus the Allen Brain Atlas\u00a0(ABA)41 (b). Coordinates are in units of one pixel (103\u00a0nm per pixel). Layers 1\u20136 are shown from left to right.Extended Data Fig. 7 Additional analysis of cortex and subcellular localization patterns in different cell types.a, Slide explorer image of the cortex and SVZ FOVs imaged in the first brain slice (n\u00a0=\u00a0913 cells). Schematic is shown in Fig.\u00a03a. b, UMAP representation of cortex and SVZ cells. c, Mapping of the choroid plexus cells, which are exclusively present in the ventricle (n\u00a0=\u00a0109 cells). d, Frequency of contacts between the different cell classes in the cortex, normalized for the abundances of cells in each cluster. e, Each strip represents cells that cluster together, which breaks into layers in the cortex, consistent with expectations, as cells within a layer preferentially interact with each other (n\u00a0=\u00a0523 cells). f, Htra1 transcripts are preferentially localized to the periphery of the astrocytes in the cortex. Left, reconstructed image from the 10,000-gene seqFISH+ experiment. Htra1 transcripts are shown in cyan, and all other transcripts are shown in black. Scale bar, 2\u00a0\u03bcm. Middle and right, a single z-slice of smFISH images of Htra1 in cortical astrocytes (scale bars, 5\u00a0\u03bcm). g, Atp1b2 localization in seqFISH+ (left; scale bar, 2\u00a0\u03bcm) and single z-slice smFISH images (middle and right; scale bars, 5\u00a0\u03bcm). Many Htra1 and Atp1b2 transcripts are localized to astrocytic processes (f, g; n\u00a0=\u00a062 astrocytes). smFISH images were background\u00a0subtracted for better display of RNA molecules (n\u00a0=\u00a010 FOVs, 40\u00d7 objective). h, Nr4a1 localization patterns are distinct from Htra1 and Atp1b2 and are more nuclear localized across different cell types. An excitatory neuron is shown from the seqFISH+ reconstructions (n\u00a0=\u00a0337 excitatory neurons; scale bars, 2\u00a0\u03bcm). i, Kif5a, a kinesin, also exhibits periphery and process localizations in different cell types (n\u00a0=\u00a060 interneurons; scale bars, 2\u00a0\u03bcm).Extended Data Fig. 8 Additional analysis of the SVZ.a, Expression of individual genes in the SVZ in UMAP representation (n\u00a0=\u00a0281 cells). b, Violin plots showing z-scored gene expression patterns for Louvain clusters corresponding to NSCs for neuroblasts in the SVZ (n\u00a0=\u00a0281 cells). c, Spatial proximity analysis of the cell clusters in the mouse SVZ. Frequency of contacts between the different cell classes in the SVZ, normalized for the abundances of cells in each cluster. d, Neural progenitors appear to be in spatial proximity with each other.\u00a0n = 281 cells (c, d). e, Two neuroblast cell clusters are found to be in spatial proximity in the SVZ. f, Subclusters of cells from cluster 7 in the cortex (left). Medium spiny neurons that express Adora2, Pde10a and Rasd2 marker genes form a separate cluster that is detected only in the striatum (right) (n\u00a0=\u00a042 cells in cluster 7).Extended Data Fig. 9 Additional analysis of the olfactory bulb.a, Slide explorer image of the olfactory bulb FOVs imaged in the second brain slice. b, UMAP analysis of olfactory bulb cells. c, Heat map of z-scored gene expression patterns of cells in the olfactory bulb. d, Violin plots show z-scored marker gene expression patterns in the different classes of cells detected in the olfactory bulb. n\u00a0=\u00a02,050 cells\u00a0(a\u2013d). e, Representative smFISH images of Th and Trh. Images were maximum z-projected. In the glomeruli layer, cluster 3 cells express both Th and Trh, whereas in the GCL, cells express Th but not Trh (clusters 5 and 22). n\u00a0=\u00a010 FOVs, 40\u00d7 objective. Scale bars, 13\u00a0\u03bcm (left images), 6.5\u00a0\u03bcm (right images). f, Frequency of contacts between the different cell classes in the glomerulus, normalized for the abundances of cells in each cluster. g, Cell clusters 3 (Th+ interneurons) and 23 (neuroblast) are in close proximity in the mapped image. Scale bars, 20\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0(f, g).Extended Data Fig. 10 Spatial organization of the olfactory bulb.a, Schematics of the FOVs imaged in the olfactory bulb. b\u2013f, Spatial mapping of the cell clusters in the glomeruli layer (b) and GCL (c\u2013f) in the olfactory bulb. Note the neuroblast cells tend to reside in the interior of the GCL (upper parts of c and d and lower parts of e and f), whereas more mature interneurons are present in the outer layer. This is consistent with the migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ through the rostral migratory stream into the GCL. Scale bars, 20\u00a0\u03bcm.Supplementary informationReporting SummarySupplementary Table 1Codebook for 10,000 genes. Base 20 pseudocolour coding scheme for each of the 10,000 genes in the three fluorescent channels.Supplementary Table 2Genes enriched in each of the cell clusters identified in the cortex and olfactory bulb data. The top 20 genes by z-score are shown. Cluster annotations are also listed.

We extend this framework for cases of transcription autoregulation and noise propagation in a simple genetic network. This model allows for the extraction of kinetic parameters of gene expression from steady-state distributions of protein concentration in a cell population, which are available from single cell data obtained by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy.Received 9 June 2006DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.168302\u00a92006 American Physical SocietyAuthors & Affiliations      \n\n\n\nNir Friedman, Long Cai, and X.

In this Correspondence, we present a sequential barcoding scheme to multiplex different mRNAs.Here, the mRNAs in cells are barcoded by sequential rounds of hybridization, imaging and probe stripping (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). As the transcripts are fixed in cells, the corresponding fluorescent spots remain in place during multiple rounds of hybridization and can be aligned to read out a fluorophore sequence. This sequential barcode is designed to uniquely identify an mRNA.Figure 1: Sequential barcoding.(a) Schematic of sequential barcoding. In each round of hybridization, 24 probes are hybridized on each transcript, imaged and then stripped by DNase I treatment. The same probe sequences are used in different rounds of hybridization (hyb), but probes are coupled to different fluorophores. (b) Composite four-color FISH data from three rounds of hybridizations on multiple yeast cells. Twelve genes are encoded by two rounds of hybridization, with the third hybridization using the same probes as hybridization 1. The boxed regions are magnified in the bottom right corner of each image. Spots colocalizing between hybridizations are detected (as outlined in insets) and have their barcodes extracted. Spots without colocalization are due to nonspecific binding of probes in the cell as well as mishybridization. The number of instances of each barcode can be quantified to provide the abundances of the corresponding transcripts in single cells.Full size imageDuring each round of hybridization, we targeted each transcript with a set of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes labeled with a single type of fluorophore. We imaged the sample and then treated it with DNase I to remove the FISH probes. In a subsequent round the mRNA was hybridized with the same FISH probes but labeled with a different dye. The number of barcodes available scales as FN, where F is the number of fluorophores and N is the number of hybridization rounds. For example, with four dyes, eight rounds of hybridization can cover the entire transcriptome (48 = 65,536). As a demonstration, we barcoded 12 genes in single yeast cells with four dyes and two rounds of hybridization (42 = 16, with four barcodes left out). We first immobilized cells on glass surfaces (Supplementary Methods). The DNA probes were hybridized, imaged and then removed by DNase I treatment (88.5% \u00b1 11.0% efficiency (\u00b1 standard deviation); Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note). The remaining signal was photobleached (Supplementary Fig. 3). Even after six hybridizations, mRNAs were observed at 70.9% \u00b1 21.8% of the original intensity (Supplementary Fig. 4). We observed that 77.9% \u00b1 5.6% of the spots that colocalized in the first two hybridizations also colocalized with the third hybridization (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). We quantified the mRNA abundances by counting the occurrence of corresponding barcodes in the cell (n = 37 cells; Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). We also show that mRNAs can be stripped and rehybridized efficiently in adherent mammalian cells (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10).Sequential barcoding has many advantages. First, it scales up quickly; with even two dyes the coding capacity is in principle unlimited. Second, during each hybridization, all available FISH probes against a transcript can be used, thereby increasing the brightness of the FISH signal. Last, barcode readout is robust, enabling full z stacks on native samples.This barcoding scheme is conceptually akin to sequencing transcripts in single cells with FISH. In contrast with the technique used by Ke et al.2, our method takes advantage of the high hybridization efficiency of FISH (>95% of the mRNAs are detected1,3) and the fact that base-pair resolution is usually not needed to uniquely identify a transcript. We note that FISH probes can also be designed to resolve a large number of splice isoforms and single-nucleotide polymorphisms3, as well as chromosome loci4, in single cells. In combination with our previous report of super-resolution FISH1, the sequential barcoding method will enable the transcriptome to be directly imaged at single-cell resolution in complex samples such as brain tissue.\n\n\nReferencesLubeck, E. & Cai, L.

Here we show, using time-lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization (typically lasting 2\u2009min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainCells sense extracellular signals and respond by regulating the expression of target genes1,2,3. This process requires two stages of information processing. First, cells encode extracellular signals internally, in the states and localization of transcription factors. Second, transcription factors activate the expression of downstream genes that will implement cellular responses1,2,3. Although many signal transduction systems have been studied extensively, it often remains unclear how signals are encoded dynamically in transcription factor activities at the single-cell level. In addition, cellular responses often involve many proteins acting together, rather than individually. However, in general it is not known how the expression levels of target genes are coordinated, allowing them to be regulated together, despite diverse promoter architectures3. Here we investigate how signal encoding and protein coordination are achieved in individual cells.We examined the calcium stress response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or budding yeast. Cellular responses to extracellular calcium are mediated by Crz1, the calcineurin-responsive zinc finger transcription factor4. The activity of Crzl is modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation4, resulting in changes in the nuclear localization of Crzl protein (Fig. 1a), rather than changes in its abundance (Supplementary Fig. 1). To understand how Crzl phosphorylation dynamics respond to calcium and regulate the more than 100 different targets necessary for calcium adaptation5, we acquired time-lapse movies of Crzl localization dynamics, using a strain in which the Crzl protein was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP)6. In each movie, we tracked the response of Crzl localization in individual cells to step changes in extracellular calcium concentration. We found that Crzl dynamics connect the encoding of signals and the coordination of target gene expression.Figure 1: \n                        Crz1 undergoes bursts of nuclear localization in response to calcium.\na, In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus. b, Filmstrip showing yeast cells with Crz1\u2013GFP before and after addition of 200\u2009mM extracellular calcium (yellow square). Frames displayed here are separated by 4.5\u2009min, but actual time resolution is higher. c, d, Two single-cell time traces showing Crz1 localization behaviour of the two cells in b. Note that there is a synchronized initial burst of nuclear localization followed by subsequent unsynchronized isolated and cluster bursts of localization. Individual burst duration, \u03c4burst, and cluster duration, \u03c4cluster, as well as the delay between calcium addition and the initial response, \u03c4delay, are defined on the traces. e, Averaged localization trace shows how single-cell burst dynamics yield partial adaptation across a population of cells.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageFrequency modulated bursts of nuclear localizationIn the absence of calcium, Crz1 was cytoplasmic in all cells (Supplementary Movie 1). Upon the addition of calcium, individual cells exhibited a rapid, synchronized burst of Crz1 nuclear localization, similar to behaviour observed with the yeast osmosensor Hog1 (refs 7, 8). However, unlike Hog1, this initial burst was followed by sporadic unsynchronized localization bursts, typically lasting about 2\u2009min (Fig. 1b\u2013d) and persisting throughout the course of the movie (up to 10\u2009h, see Supplementary Movie 1). Moreover, these single-cell Crz1 dynamics are consistent with microarray studies performed on cell populations5: after a step change in calcium, an initial overshoot in messenger RNA levels of Crz1 target genes results from the initial synchronous burst of Crz1, whereas the subsequent elevated average expression levels are due to sustained unsynchronized bursts in individual cells (Fig. 1c\u2013e).We next addressed how the amount of calcium affects the dynamics of nuclear localization. We observed that the fraction of cells with nuclear-localized Crz1 increased with calcium concentration. Because Crz1 localizes in bursts, this calcium dependence could in principle result from increases in burst frequency or duration. Strikingly, analysis of movies revealed that only the burst frequency increased (Fig. 2a), whereas the distribution of burst durations remained constant at all calcium concentrations (Fig. 2b). This distribution was consistent with two rate-limiting stochastic steps, each with a timescale of about 70\u2009s (Fig. 2b). Thus, cells use stereotyped Crz1 localization bursts in a frequency-modulated fashion to encode and respond to extracellular calcium. This contrasts with amplitude-modulation control, in which the fraction of Crz1 molecules found in the nucleus would change with calcium, but remain constant over time.Figure 2: \n                        Calcium modulates the frequency, but not the duration, of Crz1 nuclear localization bursts.\na, Frequency of bursts increases with calcium concentration (error bars calculated by using different thresholds for burst determination, see Supplementary Information). b, Burst duration is independent of calcium concentration. Normalized histograms, h(t) of total burst duration at two calcium concentrations are both well fit by h(t)\u2009 = te-t/\u03c4 with \u03c4 = 70\u2009s (black line). c, The proportion of cells that respond initially to extracellular calcium increases with the calcium concentration. Bars represent the fraction of cells with nuclear-localized Crz1 within 15\u2009min of addition of calcium. d, Average autocorrelation functions of localization trajectories (n = 58 and 85 cells respectively) from a population of cells at two calcium concentrations. At low Ca2+ concentrations (blue, 50\u2009mM), the autocorrelation can be well fit by a single exponential with timescale \u03c4burst\u2009\u2248\u200960\u2009s, whereas at high Ca2+ concentrations (red, 200\u2009mM), two timescales of fluctuations emerge, \u03c4burst\u2009\u2248\u200960 s and \u03c4cluster\u2009\u2248\u2009720\u2009s, corresponding to isolated and clustered bursts, respectively. Inset shows the relative weight of the clustered bursts, which appear at Ca2+ concentrations greater than 100\u2009mM and increase in frequency as calcium increases. Error bars are estimated from bootstrap.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageMovies also revealed two modes of nuclear localization bursts: isolated individual bursts and clusters of bursts, analogous to spike trains in neurons (Fig. 1c, d). At calcium concentrations less than 100\u2009mM, only isolated bursts were observed and the averaged autocorrelation function of the localization trajectories from individual cells was well fitted by a single exponential. However, as clustered bursts emerged at calcium concentrations greater than 100\u2009mM (Fig. 1c, d), the averaged autocorrelation function was better fit by a sum of two exponentials, whose timescales matched the typical durations of isolated bursts and burst clusters, respectively (Fig. 2d). Higher levels of calcium led to an increasing proportion of bursts occurring in clusters (Fig. 2d inset). Eventually, at the highest calcium levels, Crz1 nuclear localization trajectories appeared more similar to sustained oscillations9 than to the isolated stochastic bursts seen at lower calcium concentrations.An additional level of quantization emerged in the initial response to a change in calcium, which exhibited an all-or-nothing response at the single-cell level. At calcium concentrations of at least 100\u2009mM, most cells displayed a synchronous initial burst of Crz1 nuclear localization. This resulted in a sharp histogram of values of \u03c4delay, defined as the time interval between calcium addition and the first burst of Crz1 nuclear localization (Fig. 1c). In contrast, at lower calcium levels of about 10\u2009mM, no synchronous initial response occurred, as reflected in the much broader distribution and larger mean of \u03c4delay. Intermediate calcium concentrations produced a mixture of the two discrete behaviours (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, rather than controlling the amplitude of the initial response, calcium modulates the proportion of fast-responding cells (Fig. 2c). Critically, in both the initial response and the subsequent bursts, we never observed persistent intermediate levels of localization. Taken together, these results reveal that Crz1 burst activity is \u2018quantized\u2019 at multiple levels in cells and that only the frequencies of burst events are modulated by extracellular calcium.Active generation of burstsBecause nuclear localization bursts occurred stochastically in single cells and were unsynchronized within a population on the same slide, they could not be driven by fluctuations in external conditions. These bursts also cannot be explained simply by independent fluctuations in the phosphorylation or localization state of individual Crz1 molecules, because each burst involves coherent translocation of a large fraction of the approximate 1,000 copies of Crz1 present per cell10. To gain insight into these dynamics, we next asked whether Crz1 bursts were related to, or driven by, other dynamic cellular phenomena.First, we acquired movies of cells expressing both the G1 cell-cycle phase marker Whi5\u2013GFP11 and Crz1\u2013mCherry. We found no evidence for cell-cycle regulation of Crz1 localization bursts, nor were bursts in daughter cells correlated with those in corresponding mother cells (Supplementary Fig. 5).Second, we examined the role of intracellular calcium, which in other cell types has been shown to exhibit spike-like dynamics12. We acquired movies of yeast cells expressing both a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based calcium sensor13 and Crz1\u2013mCherry. We observed sporadic transient spikes in intracellular calcium lasting about 38\u2009s (Supplementary Fig. 7). These spikes coincided with some Crz1 localization bursts (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6). However, Crz1 localization bursts also occurred without corresponding calcium spikes, indicating that localization bursts may be stimulated by calcium spikes, but are not exclusively determined by them.Figure 3: \n                        Crz1 localization bursts are partially independent of other cellular processes and affect downstream gene expression.\na, Time traces of Crz1\u2013mCherry localization (blue) in arbitrary units and FRET ratio changes (black), indicating intracellular calcium levels. Arrows indicate spontaneous calcium spikes coincident with Crz1 localization bursts. b, Single-cell time traces of Crz1\u2013mCherry (blue) and the Crz1high\u2013GFP mutant (green) with increased affinity to calcineurin. Both Crz1 proteins are expressed and measured simultaneously in the same cell. c, Single-cell traces of Crz1\u2013mCherry and Msn2\u2013GFP in the same cell. Note that the two proteins exhibit statistically similar burst-like behaviour but only weak correlation. d, Crz1\u2013mCherry localization (blue) increases expression of the Crz1 target synthetic promoter (2\u00d7CDRE) (red). Transcriptional bursts in p2\u00d7CDRE\u2013Venus are preceded by corresponding Crz1 localization bursts. Note that not all Crz1 localization bursts result in observable transcriptional bursts, suggesting additional levels of stochasticity in transcription initiation. Inset shows positive cross-correlation (n = 9 cells) between the promoter activity and Crz1 localization with a delay corresponding to target protein maturation. Error bars are estimated from bootstrap.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageThird, we asked whether Crz1 bursts are driven by fluctuations in calcineurin, the upstream phosphatase that initiates Crz1 nuclear localization14. We analysed a Crz1 mutant15 with higher affinity to calcineurin, GFP-Crz1high, together with Crz1\u2013mCherry simultaneously in the same cell. If Crz1 bursts were just passive readouts of spikes in calcineurin activity, one would expect both types of Crz1 to burst simultaneously, with amplitudes related to their relative calcineurin affinities. Instead, we observed that Crz1high exhibited an increased burst frequency. Wild-type Crz1 bursts were a subset of these Crz1high bursts (Fig. 3b). Similarly, sub-saturating concentrations of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (ref. 16) reduced the frequency of bursts, but did not affect their amplitude (Supplementary Fig. 8). As the calcineurin\u2013Crz1 interaction controls only the frequency of burst initiation, Crz1 localization dynamics do not simply follow upstream fluctuations in calcineurin activity.Finally, to investigate the generality of localization bursts, we examined Msn2, a general stress-response transcription factor that was previously reported to exhibit nuclear localization oscillations17,18,19. We found that Msn2\u2013GFP localization is induced by calcium stress. Like Crz1, it localized in short bursts on a timescale of 1.5\u20132\u2009min, and exhibited clustered bursts (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 9). However, despite these statistical similarities, bursts of the two proteins were largely uncorrelated when observed simultaneously in the same cells under calcium stress (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 10). Of the Msn2\u2013GFP bursts, 18.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0% coincided with Crz1\u2013mCherry bursts, a fraction only slightly higher than the 14.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2% of overlapping events expected by chance if the two proteins burst independently (Supplementary Information). Furthermore, bursts of Msn2 nuclear localization can occur in the absence of calcium, whereas Crz1 bursts cannot. Similarly, we observed that the glucose-responsive repressor Mig1 exhibited bursts of nuclear localization at low glucose concentrations. These results suggest that cells operate multiple transcription-factor localization burst systems in a largely independent manner.The functional role of frequency modulationWhat effect do frequency-modulation-regulated Crz1 localization bursts have on downstream genes? We analysed the transcriptional activity of a synthetic Crz1-dependent promoter containing two calcineurin-dependent response elements (2\u00d7CDRE)20, driving expression of the fluorescent protein Venus. We also monitored Crz1\u2013mCherry localization simultaneously in the same cell (Fig. 3d). We found that the promoter was expressed in transcriptional bursts that followed Crz1 localization bursts (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, not all Crz1 localization bursts resulted in observable transcriptional bursts, suggesting that transcription initiation is probabilistic. Nevertheless, the rate of Venus production (time derivative of fluorescence) was correlated with Crz1\u2013mCherry bursts with a time-delay comparable to the maturation time of the Venus fluorophore, as expected (Fig. 3d inset and Supplementary Fig. 12). We observed similar results with a natural Crz1 target gene, Cmk2 (Supplementary Fig. 11)5. Thus, transcription-factor localization bursts propagate to downstream targets, and represent a general mechanism for generating \u2018transcriptional bursting\u201921,22,23 in downstream gene expression24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.Standard models of gene regulation involve amplitude modulation, or analogue, changes in transcription-factor concentration in response to external signals. What biological functions could the frequency modulation form of regulation observed here provide for the cell? Crz1 regulates more than 100 different target genes5, including Ca2+ pumps and structural proteins necessary for calcium adaptation. The target promoters of these genes may differ in their input functions, defined as the dependence of transcription rate on the concentration of transcription factor in the nucleus. Input functions vary widely in their minimal and maximal levels of expression, the concentration of transcription factor at which they reach half-maximal activity, and in the sharpness, or cooperativity, of their response35. We used an analytic model to show that frequency-modulation regulation of nuclear localization bursts could allow transcription factors to modulate the expression of multiple target genes in concert, keeping their relative abundances fixed over a wide dynamic range, regardless of the shapes of their input functions.This hypothesis can be understood by comparing the effects that amplitude- and frequency-modulation regulation systems have on two hypothetical target promoters, labelled A and B, with different input functions (Fig. 4b, e, grey dashed curves). In the amplitude-modulation regulation system, the fraction of Crz1 molecules in the nucleus, Crz1nuc, would increase with calcium, but remain constant over time (Fig. 4a, b). Accordingly, histograms of Crz1nuc would exhibit a single peak whose position is calcium-dependent (Fig. 4b). The expression level of each gene would be proportional to its input function evaluated at this peak position. Because it is expected that these input functions would, in general, differ in shape, the normalized rates of A and B expression would vary differently with Crz1nuc, and hence their ratio would vary with calcium (Fig. 4c). Thus, in the amplitude modulation model, A and B would be expressed in an \u2018uncoordinated\u2019 fashion.Figure 4: \n                        Frequency- versus amplitude-modulation regulation of two hypothetical target genes, labelled A and B (schematic).\na, In the amplitude-modulation regulation system, the fraction of nuclear Crz1 (Crz1nuc) changes with calcium, but remains constant over time. b, As such, the histogram of Crz1nuc yields single peaks at calcium-dependent positions. Target gene expression level is proportional to the input functions at these peak positions. c, Because their input functions differ, the normalized rates of A and B expression vary differently with nuclear Crz1, and hence with calcium, yielding different (uncoordinated) expression profiles as a function of calcium. d, In frequency modulation, where Crz1 molecules collectively move between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, Crz1nuc is either high or low, during or between bursts, respectively. This graph depicts the limiting case of rapid and complete transitions between two states, but results do not depend on this assumption (see Supplementary Information). e, This yields a bimodal histogram in which the height, but not the position, of the peak is calcium dependent. f, Consequently, the expression levels of A and B are each proportional to burst frequency, and hence to each other, yielding coordinated expression, as shown.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageIn contrast, frequency-modulation regulation (Fig. 4d) would control the fraction of time that Crz1 is nuclear, rather than the concentration of nuclear Crz1. In the limiting case of switching between two localization levels, this would cause Crz1nuc to be either high, during a burst, or very low, between bursts, but rarely in between, resulting in a bimodal Crz1nuc histogram (Fig. 4e). The expression level of each target promoter would be determined mainly by the value of its input function near the location of the higher histogram peak, and by the fraction of time Crz1 spends in the localized state, which determines the height of the peak. In frequency-modulation regulation, higher levels of calcium would increase the relative height of this peak, by increasing the frequency of bursts, but would not change its position (Fig. 4e). The expression levels of the two genes would therefore be individually proportional to the burst frequency, and consequently remain proportional to each other, as calcium is varied. Thus, A and B would be coordinated, expressed at a constant ratio at all calcium levels, regardless of the shapes of their input functions (Fig. 4f).This regulatory strategy is general: it does not require bursts to saturate target promoter input functions, nor does it require that the Crz1nuc histogram be bimodal (see Supplementary Information for a more detailed treatment). Thus, it functions with bursts, such as those observed here, that span a range of localization amplitudes, giving rise to a non-bimodal histogram. Finally, this strategy is more general than frequency-modulation regulation; it can also work by varying the duration, rather than the frequency, of localization bursts. We refer to this principle as FM-coordination.Experimental validation of FM-coordinationTo test the FM-coordination hypothesis experimentally, we first analysed three synthetic promoters containing one, two or four CDREs. These promoters were previously shown to exhibit Crz1-dependent expression in response to calcium20. We used flow cytometry to analyse strains containing each of these three promoters fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The promoters varied in their expression strength over two orders of magnitude, in the ratio 1:15:450, respectively (Fig. 5a inset). Nevertheless, they exhibited identical dependence on calcium, collapsing onto a single curve when normalized, as predicted by FM-coordination (Fig. 5a).Figure 5: \n                        Frequency-modulated bursts coordinate gene expression.\na, Measured expression levels of synthetic Crz1 target promoters containing one, two and four CDREs. In each case, expression levels are normalized by their maximum. Note the similarity of curves to each other and to burst frequency. Bottom inset shows expression at 200\u2009mM calcium normalized by the expression of the 1\u00d7CDRE. b, Expression profiles of natural target promoters (solid lines) exhibit similar inductions as the Crz1 burst frequency (dashed line). Only ten are plotted here for clarity. Error bars indicate standard error from repeated experiments. Induction curves for 64 genes are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14. c, Expression level of synthetic target genes at wild-type versus overexpressed levels of Crz1. Each promoter is normalized by its maximum expression in cells with wild-type Crz1 levels. Thus the normalized expression levels of one, two and four CDREs at [Crz1]wt each equal 1. If all promoter input functions were identical, then their normalized expression should increase by the same factor when Crz1 is overexpressed. However, the data show a range of fold changes in expression levels, excluding identical input function shapes as an explanation for proportional regulation. d, Same as c for the natural promoters in b.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageNatural eukaryotic promoters exhibit more diverse architectures than these pure synthetic promoters. Therefore, we also investigated whether FM-coordination could explain the behaviour of natural Crz1 target genes. A previous microarray study identified 163 potential Crz1 target genes5, 83 of which were available as fluorescent protein fusions6. Of these, 40 showed a measurable and predominantly calcineurin-dependent response to calcium under our media conditions (Supplementary Fig. 15). These natural promoters, like their synthetic counterparts, exhibited a broad distribution of expression levels (Supplementary Figs 14 and 17). Notably, a large subset of these target genes (34 out of 40) exhibited normalized calcium response curves identical to each other and to those of the synthetic promoters. They were thus regulated in proportion to burst frequency, in accordance with FM-coordination (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 14a).In principle, target promoters could respond proportionally because they share identical input functions. If so, increasing total Crz1 concentration would increase the expression of all promoters by the same factor (Fig. 5c, d). Conversely, if the expression levels of the promoters change by different factors when Crz1 concentration is increased, then their input functions must differ in shape. This is what we observed when we compared the expression of both the synthetic and natural promoters in wild-type strains with their expression in a Crz1-overexpressing strain36. The increase in expression varied between onefold and sevenfold over this set of promoters (Fig. 5c, d), confirming that synthetic and natural promoters are proportionally regulated by the FM-coordination mechanism, despite non-identical input functions.DiscussionDiverse perturbations including calcium, pharmacological inhibitors and genetic mutations vary mean Crz1 activity across a broad dynamic range exclusively by affecting the frequency of localization bursts, rather than their duration or amplitude. Thus, Crz1 activity is quantized both in its initial response to a step change in calcium, which is all-or-nothing at the single-cell level, and in its sustained response, which is composed of stereotyped bursts of localization. These data suggest that eukaryotic cells can encode information about the extracellular environment in the frequency of stochastic intracellular events, rather than in the concentrations of molecular species. This contrasts with canonical signal transduction pathways, in which concentrations of activated proteins are used to convey information to the nucleus. Using localization as a single-cell reporter for post-translational modifications, we observed qualitatively similar, but largely uncorrelated, behaviour in the Msn2 stress-response transcription factor and the Mig1 glucose repressor, suggesting that localization bursts are broadly used in the cell.In engineering, frequency modulation appears in diverse signal processing and control applications such as broadcasting37 and rocket thruster control38. Spike frequency control, or rate coding, is also fundamental to neural computation39, where it may overcome noise background for signal propagation, among other functions40. In genetic networks, frequency-modulation regulation solves a fundamental problem, allowing cells to co-regulate proportionally a large set of target genes with a diverse range of input functions. Note also that these results represent a complementary mode of regulation compared with previous observations of calcium oscillation frequency-dependent gene expression41. FM-coordination connects the dynamic behaviour of a single protein to the expression of large regulons, and may thus provide insight into genome-scale expression patterns. Furthermore, at the evolutionary level, FM-coordination enables promoter mutations to alter the level of expression of individual genes without disrupting their coordination. In contrast, to achieve coordinate regulation using amplitude modulation would require \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 of target promoter input functions, severely constraining promoter architecture and regulatory evolution. In light of previous observations of transcription-factor pulsing in p53 (ref. 42), NF\u03baB43 and SOS stress-response systems44, and because of its potential use in protein and metabolic, as well as transcriptional, networks, we anticipate that frequency-modulated regulation may represent a general principle by which cells coordinate their response to signals.Methods SummaryStrain constructionAll GFP strains were obtained from the GFP carboxy-terminal protein fusion library (Invitrogen)6. All other strains were constructed similarly to the library: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify fluorescent proteins45, which were then transformed into the w303a laboratory strain of yeast46,47. FRET13 and Crz1 mutant plasmids15 were transformed into a Crz1\u2013cherry strain. A Crz1 overexpression plasmid46 was transformed into 83 Crz1 target gene\u2013GFP strains. YFP was ligated into synthetic promoter (CDRE) plasmids20 and transformed into laboratory and Crz1\u2013cherry strains.Time-lapse microscopyCells were attached to glass-bottom dishes (Willco) functionalized with concanavalin-A (Sigma). Fluorescence images were taken at room temperature on an Olympus IX81 with the ZDC autofocus option and an Andor Ikon (DU-934) camera. CaCl2 was added during movies to nominal concentrations using a 2\u00d7 stock solution. Images were acquired at 10-s intervals for single-colour movies and at 30-s intervals for two-colour and FRET movies. Automation was controlled by Andor IQ software. Two-colour movies of Crz1 and downstream targets were taken at 30\u2009\u00b0C to ensure fast maturation of the Venus fluorophore.Flow cytometryYeast cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates and diluted. Upon addition of calcium, cells were then regrown for 4\u20136\u2009h and diluted fivefold. Gene expression was then measured using a Beckman Coulter Cell Lab Quanta SC MPL.Image analysisFluorescence images were segmented using a Hough transformation algorithm in Matlab48. Localization score was determined by the difference between the mean intensity of the five brightest pixels in the cell and mean intensity of the rest of the pixels in the cell. Bursts were identified by thresholding traces at more than one standard deviation above background noise, estimated from the lowest 20% of values. Subsequent data analysis used the resulting traces with standard routines in Matlab and Mathematica.Online MethodsStrain constructionAll GFP strains were obtained from the GFP C-terminal protein fusion library (Invitrogen)6. All other strains were constructed similarly to the library: PCR was used to amplify cassettes with yeast codon-optimized fluorescent proteins tagged to an auxotrophic marker35. These amplified cassettes were made with primers containing 40\u2009base-pair homology towards the carboxy terminus of the protein of interest. The cassettes were then transformed into the w303a laboratory strain of yeast using standard protocols36. Transformants were selected using standard yeast media37. Plasmid pGW845, a vector containing the FRET cameleon pair under the control of the ADH1 promoter, was provided by J. Stadler13; and p30, the Crz1high mutant with altered calcineurin affinity, was provided by M. Cyert15. Both were transformed directly into a yeast strain containing Crz1\u2013mCherry (Fig. 3b). A Crz1 overexpression plasmid, pLE66, provided by K. Cunningham26, was transformed into each of 83 Crz1 target strains from the GFP library. A BamHI fragment of yeast-codon-optimized Venus\u2013YFP, cut from pKT103 (ref. 35), was ligated into pAMS342, pAMS363 and pAMS366, provided by M. Cyert, containing one, two and four CDREs respectively20.MediaYeast were grown in synthetic complete or the appropriate drop-out media made using low-fluorescence yeast nitrogen, adapted from previous work35.

Cells were regrown in the calcium for 4\u20136\u2009h, diluted fivefold, and gene expression was measured using a Beckman Coulter Cell Lab Quanta SC MPL. To identify cells, all particles were triggered and gated during acquisition. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 13, particles were triggered if their Coulter volume measurements were within a specified range. Either 5,000 particles or a 30-\u00b5l sample volume were acquired. These particles were then excited by a 22-mW 488-nm laser, and side-scatter and fluorescence were measured. A polygon gate was drawn on the Coulter volume/side-scatter two-parameter plot to identify cells. If more than 500 cells were found, mean fluorescence was calculated. Quanta photomultiplier tube settings were 3.5 for side-scatter, 8.00 for GFP measurements and from 4 to 6 for synthetic promoter\u2013YFP measurements.Image analysisFluorescence cell images were segmented using a Hough transformation algorithm in Matlab, provided by S. Ramanathan38. Localization score was determined by the difference between the mean intensity of the five brightest pixels in the cell and mean intensity of the rest of the pixels in the cell. Bursts were identified by thresholding traces at more than one standard deviation above background noise, estimated from the lowest 20% of values.

Bulk biochemistry and imaging of fixed cells have pictured the transcription factors as translocating to the nucleus in all-or-none fashion. But now a dynamic, single-cell analysis in yeast cells reveals that translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus occurs in bursts. The frequency \u2014 but not amplitude \u2014 of these bursts varies in response to environmental conditions. Computer modelling suggests that frequency modulation allows for precisely coordinated regulation of target genes, without a need for fine-tuning their promoter strength. And experimental results suggest that the phenomenon is general.show all\n\n\nSectionsFiguresReferencesAbstractMainFrequency modulated bursts of nuclear localizationActive generation of burstsThe functional role of frequency modulationExperimental validation of FM-coordinationDiscussionMethods SummaryOnline MethodsReferencesAcknowledgementsAuthor informationSupplementary informationPowerPoint slidesRights and permissionsAbout this articleThis article is cited byComments\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \n                        Crz1 undergoes bursts of nuclear localization in response to calcium.\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 2: \n                        Calcium modulates the frequency, but not the duration, of Crz1 nuclear localization bursts.\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 3: \n                        Crz1 localization bursts are partially independent of other cellular processes and affect downstream gene expression.\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 4: \n                        Frequency- versus amplitude-modulation regulation of two hypothetical target genes, labelled A and B (schematic).\nView in articleFull size imageFigure 5: \n                        Frequency-modulated bursts coordinate gene expression.\nView in articleFull size image\nCyert, M.

Current methods for studying genome-wide structure are based on proximity ligation. However, this approach can fail to detect known structures, such as interactions with nuclear bodies, because these DNA regions can be too far apart to directly ligate. Accordingly, our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. We show that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential organization relative to these nuclear bodies. Our results generate a global model whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall packaging of DNA in the nucleus.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (252KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsNuclear structurenuclear organizationgenome structurenuclear specklenucleolusSPRITERNA DNA interactionshigher-order nuclear structuremulti-way interactionsRecommended articlesCited by (0)7Lead Contact\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

At intermediate inducer concentrations, a population of genetically identical cells exhibits two phenotypes: induced cells with highly fluorescent membranes and uninduced cells with a small number of membrane-bound permeases. We found that this basal-level expression results from partial dissociation of the tetrameric lactose repressor from one of its operators on looped DNA. In contrast, infrequent events of complete dissociation of the repressor from DNA result in large bursts of permease expression that trigger induction of the lac operon. Hence, a stochastic single-molecule event determines a cell's phenotype.\n\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE SCIENCE eTOC\nGet the latest table of contents from Science delivered right to you!\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nGenetically identical cells in the same environment can exhibit different phenotypes, and a single cell can switch between distinct phenotypes in a stochastic manner (1\u20134). In the classic example of lactose metabolism in Escherichia coli, the lac genes are fully expressed for every cell in a population under high extracellular concentrations of inducers, such as the lactose analog methyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (TMG). However, at moderate inducer concentrations, the lac genes are highly expressed in only a fraction of a population, which may confer a fitness advantage for the entire population (5). We studied the molecular mechanism that controls the stochastic phenotype switching of a single cell.Lactose metabolism is controlled by the lac operon (6, 7), which consists of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes encoding \u03b2-galactosidase, lactose permease, and transacetylase, respectively. Expression of the operon is regulated by a transcription factor, the lac repressor (8), which dissociates from its specific binding sequences of DNA, the lac operators, in the presence of an inducer to allow transcription (Fig. 1A). The production of the permease increases inducer influx (9), which results in positive feedback on the permease expression level. Above a certain threshold of permease numbers, a cell will remain in a phenotype that is capable of lactose metabolism, and below this threshold, a cell will remain in a phenotype that is incapable of lactose metabolism (10, 11). The former has high fluorescence from the cell membrane when the permease is labeled with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), whereas the latter has low fluorescence. The image in Fig. 1B shows the coexistence of both phenotypes in a cell population at intermediate inducer concentrations, characterized by the bimodal distributions of fluorescence intensity in Fig. 1C. Fig. 1. The expression of lactose permease in E. coli. (A) The repressor LacI and permease LacY form a positive feedback loop. Expression of permease increases the intracellular concentration of the inducer TMG, which causes dissociation of LacI from the promoter, leading to even more expression of permeases. Cells with a sufficient number of permeases will quickly reach a state of full induction, whereas cells with too few permeases will stay uninduced. (B) After 24 hours in M9 medium containing 30 \u03bcM TMG, strain SX700 expressing a LacY-YFP fusion exhibits all-or-none fluorescence in a fluorescence-phase contrast overlay (bottom, image dimensions 31 \u03bcm \u00d7 31 \u03bcm). Fluorescence imaging with high sensitivity reveals single molecules of permease in the uninduced cells (top, image dimensions 8 \u03bcm \u00d7 13 \u03bcm). (C) After 1 day of continuous growth in medium containing 0 to 50 \u03bcM TMG, the resulting bimodal fluorescence distributions show that a fraction of the population exists either in an uninduced or induced state, with the relative fractions depending on the TMG concentration. (D) The distributions of LacY-YFP molecules in the uninduced fraction of the bimodal population at different TMG concentrations, measured with single-molecule sensitivity, indicate that one permease molecule is not enough to induce the lac operon, as previously hypothesized (12). More than 100 cells were analyzed at each concentration. Error bars are SE determined by bootstrapping.Expand for moreOpen in viewerAlthough it is known that the bistability in the lac operon arises from positive feedback (12, 13), the molecular mechanism underlying the initiation of switching between two phenotypes remains unclear. Novick and Weiner deduced that switching from the uninduced state to the induced state occurs through a single rate-limiting molecular process (12) rather than a multistep process. They further hypothesized that the random expression of one molecule of permease was enough to trigger induction. However, this has never been observed experimentally because of insufficient sensitivity.Our group has previously shown that a single fluorescent protein molecule can be visualized in a living bacterial cell by using the method of detection by localization (14\u201316). Because a permease molecule is a membrane protein with slow diffusion, its fluorescence label is highly localized as compared with a fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm, which allows for its detection above the background of cellular autofluorescence. Thus, we generated strain SX700, which possesses intact lac promoter elements and expresses a functional LacY-YFP fusion protein (fig. S1) from lacY's native chromosomal position (fig. S2). Figure 1B shows a fluorescence image of SX700 cells that allows us to directly count the number of single LacY-YFP molecules present in a cell.Figure 1D shows the histogram of permease copy numbers in the uninduced fraction of cells, free from the complication of autofluorescence background in the lower peak of Fig. 1C. Evidently, the uninduced cells have 0 to 10 LacY molecules with significant probability, independent of the inducer concentration. Had one permease been enough to trigger induction, all cells in the uninduced subpopulation would have contained zero LacY molecules. Thus, we conclude that a single copy of LacY is not sufficient to induce switching of the phenotype, and the threshold for induction must be much higher than several molecules per cell.We then set out to determine the threshold of permease molecules for induction. It is experimentally difficult to capture the rare events of phenotype switching in real time. To overcome this difficulty, we prepared cells covering a broad range of permease copy numbers by first fully inducing the cells and subsequently washing out the inducer. We then allowed the cells to divide for one to six generations, during which the initial permeases were partitioned into daughter cells (17). Figure 2A shows fluorescence time traces of the cells, normalized by cell size, upon the reintroduction of 40 \u03bcM TMG. Although the fluorescence in cells with low permease numbers continued to decay because of cell division and photobleaching, cells with more than 300 initial permease molecules induced again within 3 hours and showed increased fluorescence. Figure 2B shows the probability of induction as a function of initial permease number, which is well fit by a Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of 4.5 and a threshold of \u223c375 molecules. The large value of the threshold indicates that hundreds of permease molecules are necessary to switch the phenotype. Fig. 2. Measurement of the threshold of permease molecules for induction. (A) Single-cell time traces of fluorescence intensity, normalized by cell size, starting from different initial permease numbers. The initial LacY-YFP numbers were prepared through dilution by cell division of fully induced cells after removal of the inducer. Upon adding 40 \u03bcM TMG at time 0, those cells with low initial permease numbers lost fluorescence with time as a result of dilution by cell division and photobleaching, whereas those cells with high initial permease numbers exhibited an increase in fluorescence as a result of reinduction. Permease molecule numbers were estimated from cell fluorescence (28). The dashed red line indicates the determined threshold. (B) The probability of induction of a cell within 3 hours as a function of the initial permease number was determined using traces from 90 cells. The probability of induction (p) was fit with a Hill equation p = y4.5/(y4.5 + 3754.5) for the initial permease number y. The threshold of permease numbers for induction was thus determined to be 375 molecules. Error bars are the inverse square root of the sample size at each point. (C) To prove that the complete dissociation of tetrameric repressor from two operators triggers induction, we constructed strain SX702 with auxiliary operators removed (no DNA looping). The figure shows single-cell traces of permease numbers in single cells grown in 40 \u03bcM TMG as a function of time. Unlike the looping strain SX700, the rapid induction of SX702 is no longer dependent on the initial number of permease molecules. This proves that phenotype switching is the result of a complete dissociation of the tetrameric repressor, as shown in (B). (D) In the absence of DNA looping, the entire population of strain SX702 rapidly induces in a coordinated manner from far below the threshold for a concentration as low as 20 \u03bcM TMG. DNA looping is necessary for bistability of the lac operon under these conditions.Expand for moreOpen in viewerIf the induction is due to a single rate-limiting event as Novick and Weiner argued, there must be a single large burst of permease expression to reach this high threshold. However, only small bursts have been observed in previous studies of the repressed lac promoter (14, 18). Large bursts, if any, would be infrequent and insufficiently sampled in the previous work. To explain why both small and large bursts may occur from the lac promoter, we considered the tetrameric repressor that is doubly bound to two operators, forming a DNA loop (19, 20). We hypothesized that more frequent partial dissociations of the tetrameric repressor from one operator lead to single transcripts and small bursts of protein expression, whereas rare complete dissociations from all operators lead to multiple transcripts and large bursts of expression. In this model, the complete dissociation of the tetrameric repressor would be the molecular event that causes a change in phenotype.To test this model experimentally, we first removed the auxiliary operators from SX700 to generate SX702 (fig. S2), which cannot form DNA loops. As a result, every dissociation event of LacI from the remaining O1 operator results in a complete dissociation event that would generate a large burst of expression. In this case, we predicted frequent and large bursts of expression with a faster rate of phenotype switching. Indeed, Fig. 2C shows that without DNA looping, SX702 induces rapidly upon the addition of inducer, even though the initial permease numbers are much smaller than the threshold in Fig. 2, A and B [see supporting online material (SOM) text]. The removal of DNA looping eliminated bistability. This was manifested by the unimodal distributions of an inducing population in Fig. 2D at 20 \u03bcMTMG.To directly observe large bursts, we replaced the lacY gene of the E. coli chromosome with a membrane-localized protein, Tsr, fused to YFP, which generated strain SX701 (fig. S2). Eliminating LacY's positive feedback served two purposes: to allow the resolution of distinct large bursts and to prove that large bursts do not require permease activity. The Tsr-YFP fusion functioned as a surrogate reporter for protein production with single-molecule sensitivity.When we acquired time-lapse fluorescence microscopy movies of SX701 cells with 200 \u03bcM TMG, we observed that Tsr-YFP was produced mostly in small bursts, but occasionally in a large burst (Fig. 3A). The distribution of burst sizes (Fig. 3B) taken from these real-time traces shows both the frequent exponentially distributed small bursts and the rare unusually large bursts. Fig. 3. Small and large bursts in the absence of positive feedback. In order to eliminate positive feedback from permease transport, we constructed strain SX701 by replacing the lactose permease with the membrane protein fusion Tsr-YFP. (A) Real-time traces of protein production in SX701 in 200 \u03bcM TMG. The fluorescent proteins were photobleached immediately after detection to ensure that only newly produced proteins were measured after each 4-min interval. Representative traces of single cells show frequent small bursts, associated with partial dissociation events, and a rare large burst, associated with a complete dissociation event, of protein production. (B) Distribution of burst sizes determined for 208 bursts from the real-time experiment depicted in (A). Although the majority of bursts are small, a number of unusually large bursts are observed. The former are attributed to partial dissociations and the latter to complete dissociations of the tetrameric repressor. (Inset) The occurrence of burst sizes smaller than 10 molecules is well-fit by an exponential distribution (red line). (C) Analysis of small bursts from partial dissociations of the tetrameric repressor shows that the distribution of YFP molecules in the range of 0 to 10 molecules does not change in the range of 0 to 200 \u03bcM TMG. A small percentage of cells have much more than 10 molecules and do not appear on the axis of this plot (fig. S7C). Over 100 cells were analyzed for each concentration. (Inset) The number of bursts per cell cycle (purple circles) increases slightly whereas the average number of proteins per burst (gray triangles) remains approximately constant. These kinetic parameters are determined from the steady-state distribution of YFP in those cells with fewer than 10 molecules (see SOM text). Error bars are standard errors determined by bootstrapping. Gamma distributions using the determined parameters are overlayed as solid lines. The gamma distribution for 200 \u03bcM is normalized for the subpopulation of cells with fewer than 10 molecules. (D) In addition to having the permease replaced with Tsr-YFP, strain SX703 has the auxiliary operators removed, eliminating DNA looping so that every dissociation event is a complete dissociation. The protein number distributions should reflect the bursts of protein expression from complete dissociations alone. (Inset) the noise parameters \u03bc2/\u03c32 (purple circles) and \u03c32/\u03bc (gray triangles) suggest that the frequency of large bursts is independent of the TMG concentration but that the burst size is not.Expand for moreOpen in viewerWe next analyzed the inducer concentration dependence of burst frequency and size by using population distributions. Figure 3C shows that SX701 has a protein copy number distribution in a cell population very similar to the distributions of uninduced cells in Fig. 1D within the range of 0 to 10 molecules. We have shown that these copy-number distributions manifest the stochasticity in gene expression characterized by two parameters, transcription rate (a) and the burst size of proteins per mRNA (b), and can be well fit with a gamma distribution p(n) = b\u2013ana\u20131e\u2013n/b/\u0393(a) (18, 21). The inset in Fig. 3C shows a and b determined in this fashion for cells with fewer than 10 molecules for different TMG concentrations. The small burst size is independent of the inducer concentration, whereas the small burst frequency has only a weak concentration dependence. In fact, within the range of 0 to 50 \u03bcM TMG, the small burst frequency does not change appreciably, suggesting that the partial repressor dissociation is predominantly spontaneous at low inducer concentrations.Because characterization of the rare, large bursts is difficult for the wild-type operators, we generated strain SX703, in which the permease gene was replaced with Tsr-YFP and the O2 and O3 operators were removed to eliminate DNA looping. Every dissociation event in the SX703 should be a complete dissociation, and hence should lead to a large burst. Because there is a 20- to 100-fold difference in the inducer-binding affinity to the repressor in DNA-bound form (\u223c1 mM) relative to the free form (\u223c10 \u03bcM) (22, 23), we expected to observe the stochastic dissociation of the repressor from the sole operator site and sequestration of the free repressor by the inducers at the concentrations we used (0 to 50 \u03bcM) rather than inducer-driven dissociation events.Consequently, we expected the frequency of dissociation to remain constant as the inducer concentration increased but expected the length of the dissociation time to increase. When we analyzed the steady-state protein distributions at different inducer concentrations (Fig. 4C) by applying a generalized interpretation of the a-b model, which estimates the number of proteins per expression bursts (SOM text), we found that inducer concentration affects the size of large bursts but not the frequency. This observation supports our model that the inducer sequesters the repressor after it stochastically dissociates from the operator and prolongs its lifetime in the non\u2013DNA-bound state, leading to larger burst sizes (SOM Text). Fig. 4. Complete dissociation of the tetrameric repressor triggers induction. (A) A high concentration of intracellular inducer can force dissociation of the repressor from its operators, as described by Monod and Jacob (6). (B) At low or intermediate concentrations of intracellular inducer, partial dissociation from one operator by the tetrameric LacI repressor is followed by a fast rebinding. Consequently, no more than one transcript is generated during such a brief dissociation event. However, the tetrameric repressor can dissociate from both operators stochastically and then be sequestered by the inducer so that it cannot rebind, leading to a large burst of expression. (C) A time-lapse sequence captures a phenotype-switching event. In the presence of 50 \u03bcM TMG, one such cell switches phenotype to express many LacY-YFP molecules (yellow fluorescence overlay) whereas the other daughter cell does not (movie S1).Open in viewerFigure 4 summarizes the model of induction in the lac operon. In the case of high inducer concentration (Fig. 4A), the repressor is actively pulled off both operator sites by the inducer, as described in Monod and Jacob's model (6). Under low or intermediate TMG concentrations, however, the repressor can stochastically dissociate from one operator independently of the inducer, as shown in Fig. 4B. When the repressor partially dissociates from one operator, a small protein burst from a single copy of mRNA is generated (14) before the repressor rapidly rebinds to the vacant operator. When the repressor completely dissociates from both operators, multiple mRNAs are transcribed, which leads to a large protein burst that surpasses the LacY threshold, initiates positive feedback, and maintains a switch in phenotype.Why do complete dissociation events give rise to large bursts? Our group has recently shown that if a repressor dissociates from DNA, it takes a time scale of minutes for the repressor to rebind to the operator because the repressor spends most of its time binding to nonspecific sequences and searching through the chromosomal DNA (15). In addition, there are only a few copies of the tetrameric repressors (8). Such a slow repressor rebinding time, relative to transcript-initiation frequencies (24), would allow multiple copies of lacY mRNA to be made following a complete repressor dissociation event. Furthermore, in the presence of inducer, the nonspecific binding constant remains unchanged (25), but the affinity of the inducer-bound repressor to the operator is substantially reduced, rendering specific rebinding unlikely. The large burst that results from slow repressor rebinding is an example of how a single-molecule fluctuation under out-of-equilibrium conditions can have considerable biological consequences, which has been discussed theoretically in the context of cell signaling (26) and gene expression (27) but has not previously been experimentally observed.Because the binding affinity of inducers for operator-bound repressors is weaker than for free repressors by a factor of 20 to 100 (22, 23), the inducer's role under low concentrations is not to force a dissociation event but to simply sequester repressors that stochastically dissociated from their operators in order to aid in creating a large burst (SOM text) (Fig. 3D). When the inducer concentration increases, the size of the large bursts increases because the duration of complete dissociations increases, improving the probability that a large burst can cross the positive-feedback threshold. Consequently, it is this higher probability of successful switch-on events that shifts the bimodal population toward the fully induced state as inducer concentration increases.The biological importance of DNA looping has been discussed in the literature in terms of facilitating interactions between distance sequences and enhancing the local concentration (19, 20). Here, we show that DNA looping allows the control of gene regulation on multiple time scales through different kinds of dissociation events. The presence of DNA looping allows the use of rare complete dissociation events to control a bistable genetic switch.We have shown that a stochastic single-molecule event can cause a change in phenotype. It is not difficult to imagine that similar molecular events might determine more complicated phenotypes of other cells or organisms. The ability to observe and probe the properties of genetic switches at the molecular level is crucial for understanding how cells make decisions.\nFootnotes*These authors contributed equally to this work.a [...] Choi b [...] Cai \u2020Present address: Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.GO TO FOOTNOTE\u2021Present address: Biophysics Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.GO TO FOOTNOTESupplementary MaterialFile (1161427s1.mov)DownloadFile (choi-som.pdf)DownloadReferences and Notes1A.

The expression of lactose permease in E. coli. (A) The repressor LacI and permease LacY form a positive feedback loop. Expression of permease increases the intracellular concentration of the inducer TMG, which causes dissociation of LacI from the promoter, leading to even more expression of permeases. Cells with a sufficient number of permeases will quickly reach a state of full induction, whereas cells with too few permeases will stay uninduced. (B) After 24 hours in M9 medium containing 30 \u03bcM TMG, strain SX700 expressing a LacY-YFP fusion exhibits all-or-none fluorescence in a fluorescence-phase contrast overlay (bottom, image dimensions 31 \u03bcm \u00d7 31 \u03bcm). Fluorescence imaging with high sensitivity reveals single molecules of permease in the uninduced cells (top, image dimensions 8 \u03bcm \u00d7 13 \u03bcm). (C) After 1 day of continuous growth in medium containing 0 to 50 \u03bcM TMG, the resulting bimodal fluorescence distributions show that a fraction of the population exists either in an uninduced or induced state, with the relative fractions depending on the TMG concentration. (D) The distributions of LacY-YFP molecules in the uninduced fraction of the bimodal population at different TMG concentrations, measured with single-molecule sensitivity, indicate that one permease molecule is not enough to induce the lac operon, as previously hypothesized (12). More than 100 cells were analyzed at each concentration. Error bars are SE determined by bootstrapping.GO TO FIGUREOPEN IN VIEWER Fig. 2. Measurement of the threshold of permease molecules for induction. (A) Single-cell time traces of fluorescence intensity, normalized by cell size, starting from different initial permease numbers. The initial LacY-YFP numbers were prepared through dilution by cell division of fully induced cells after removal of the inducer. Upon adding 40 \u03bcM TMG at time 0, those cells with low initial permease numbers lost fluorescence with time as a result of dilution by cell division and photobleaching, whereas those cells with high initial permease numbers exhibited an increase in fluorescence as a result of reinduction. Permease molecule numbers were estimated from cell fluorescence (28). The dashed red line indicates the determined threshold. (B) The probability of induction of a cell within 3 hours as a function of the initial permease number was determined using traces from 90 cells. The probability of induction (p) was fit with a Hill equation p = y4.5/(y4.5 + 3754.5) for the initial permease number y. The threshold of permease numbers for induction was thus determined to be 375 molecules. Error bars are the inverse square root of the sample size at each point. (C) To prove that the complete dissociation of tetrameric repressor from two operators triggers induction, we constructed strain SX702 with auxiliary operators removed (no DNA looping). The figure shows single-cell traces of permease numbers in single cells grown in 40 \u03bcM TMG as a function of time. Unlike the looping strain SX700, the rapid induction of SX702 is no longer dependent on the initial number of permease molecules. This proves that phenotype switching is the result of a complete dissociation of the tetrameric repressor, as shown in (B). (D) In the absence of DNA looping, the entire population of strain SX702 rapidly induces in a coordinated manner from far below the threshold for a concentration as low as 20 \u03bcM TMG. DNA looping is necessary for bistability of the lac operon under these conditions.GO TO FIGUREOPEN IN VIEWER Fig. 3. Small and large bursts in the absence of positive feedback. In order to eliminate positive feedback from permease transport, we constructed strain SX701 by replacing the lactose permease with the membrane protein fusion Tsr-YFP. (A) Real-time traces of protein production in SX701 in 200 \u03bcM TMG. The fluorescent proteins were photobleached immediately after detection to ensure that only newly produced proteins were measured after each 4-min interval. Representative traces of single cells show frequent small bursts, associated with partial dissociation events, and a rare large burst, associated with a complete dissociation event, of protein production. (B) Distribution of burst sizes determined for 208 bursts from the real-time experiment depicted in (A). Although the majority of bursts are small, a number of unusually large bursts are observed. The former are attributed to partial dissociations and the latter to complete dissociations of the tetrameric repressor. (Inset) The occurrence of burst sizes smaller than 10 molecules is well-fit by an exponential distribution (red line). (C) Analysis of small bursts from partial dissociations of the tetrameric repressor shows that the distribution of YFP molecules in the range of 0 to 10 molecules does not change in the range of 0 to 200 \u03bcM TMG. A small percentage of cells have much more than 10 molecules and do not appear on the axis of this plot (fig. S7C). Over 100 cells were analyzed for each concentration. (Inset) The number of bursts per cell cycle (purple circles) increases slightly whereas the average number of proteins per burst (gray triangles) remains approximately constant. These kinetic parameters are determined from the steady-state distribution of YFP in those cells with fewer than 10 molecules (see SOM text). Error bars are standard errors determined by bootstrapping. Gamma distributions using the determined parameters are overlayed as solid lines. The gamma distribution for 200 \u03bcM is normalized for the subpopulation of cells with fewer than 10 molecules. (D) In addition to having the permease replaced with Tsr-YFP, strain SX703 has the auxiliary operators removed, eliminating DNA looping so that every dissociation event is a complete dissociation. The protein number distributions should reflect the bursts of protein expression from complete dissociations alone. (Inset) the noise parameters \u03bc2/\u03c32 (purple circles) and \u03c32/\u03bc (gray triangles) suggest that the frequency of large bursts is independent of the TMG concentration but that the burst size is not.GO TO FIGUREOPEN IN VIEWER Fig. 4. Complete dissociation of the tetrameric repressor triggers induction. (A) A high concentration of intracellular inducer can force dissociation of the repressor from its operators, as described by Monod and Jacob (6). (B) At low or intermediate concentrations of intracellular inducer, partial dissociation from one operator by the tetrameric LacI repressor is followed by a fast rebinding. Consequently, no more than one transcript is generated during such a brief dissociation event. However, the tetrameric repressor can dissociate from both operators stochastically and then be sequestered by the inducer so that it cannot rebind, leading to a large burst of expression. (C) A time-lapse sequence captures a phenotype-switching event. In the presence of 50 \u03bcM TMG, one such cell switches phenotype to express many LacY-YFP molecules (yellow fluorescence overlay) whereas the other daughter cell does not (movie S1).GO TO FIGUREOPEN IN VIEWERMultimediaTablesShareShareShare article linkhttps://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1161427Copy LinkCopied!Copying failed.Share on social mediaFacebookTwitterLinkedinemailFiguresTablesView figure Fig. 1 Fig. 1. The expression of lactose permease in E. coli. (A) The repressor LacI and permease LacY form a positive feedback loop. Expression of permease increases the intracellular concentration of the inducer TMG, which causes dissociation of LacI from the promoter, leading to even more expression of permeases. Cells with a sufficient number of permeases will quickly reach a state of full induction, whereas cells with too few permeases will stay uninduced. (B) After 24 hours in M9 medium containing 30 \u03bcM TMG, strain SX700 expressing a LacY-YFP fusion exhibits all-or-none fluorescence in a fluorescence-phase contrast overlay (bottom, image dimensions 31 \u03bcm \u00d7 31 \u03bcm). Fluorescence imaging with high sensitivity reveals single molecules of permease in the uninduced cells (top, image dimensions 8 \u03bcm \u00d7 13 \u03bcm). (C) After 1 day of continuous growth in medium containing 0 to 50 \u03bcM TMG, the resulting bimodal fluorescence distributions show that a fraction of the population exists either in an uninduced or induced state, with the relative fractions depending on the TMG concentration. (D) The distributions of LacY-YFP molecules in the uninduced fraction of the bimodal population at different TMG concentrations, measured with single-molecule sensitivity, indicate that one permease molecule is not enough to induce the lac operon, as previously hypothesized (12). More than 100 cells were analyzed at each concentration. Error bars are SE determined by bootstrapping.View figure Fig. 2 Fig. 2. Measurement of the threshold of permease molecules for induction. (A) Single-cell time traces of fluorescence intensity, normalized by cell size, starting from different initial permease numbers. The initial LacY-YFP numbers were prepared through dilution by cell division of fully induced cells after removal of the inducer. Upon adding 40 \u03bcM TMG at time 0, those cells with low initial permease numbers lost fluorescence with time as a result of dilution by cell division and photobleaching, whereas those cells with high initial permease numbers exhibited an increase in fluorescence as a result of reinduction. Permease molecule numbers were estimated from cell fluorescence (28). The dashed red line indicates the determined threshold. (B) The probability of induction of a cell within 3 hours as a function of the initial permease number was determined using traces from 90 cells. The probability of induction (p) was fit with a Hill equation p = y4.5/(y4.5 + 3754.5) for the initial permease number y. The threshold of permease numbers for induction was thus determined to be 375 molecules. Error bars are the inverse square root of the sample size at each point.

Using an in\u00a0situ 3D multiplexed imaging method, seqFISH, we identify unique transcriptional states by quantifying and clustering up to 249 genes in 16,958 cells to examine whether the hippocampus is organized into transcriptionally distinct subregions. We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states. In addition, we found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. These structures and patterns are observed using different mice and different sets of genes. Together, these results demonstrate the power of seqFISH in transcriptional profiling of complex tissues.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightLoading...Recommended articlesCited by (0)4Co-first author5Lead Contact\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.Recommended articlesNavigate DownLoading...Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

However, the number of molecular species that can be measured simultaneously is limited by the spectral overlap between fluorophores. Here we demonstrate a simple but general strategy to drastically increase the capacity for multiplex detection of molecules in single cells by using optical super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and combinatorial labeling. As a proof of principle, we labeled mRNAs with unique combinations of fluorophores using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and resolved the sequences and combinations of fluorophores with SRM. We measured mRNA levels of 32 genes simultaneously in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. These experiments demonstrate that combinatorial labeling and super-resolution imaging of single cells is a natural approach to bring systems biology into single cells.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainThe aim of systems biology researchers is to quantitatively understand the interactions between many biological components. To do so, researchers use two distinct technical approaches: genomics1,2,3,4, to analyze all genes and proteins in a system simultaneously, and single-cell biology5,6,7,8,9,10, to follow gene expression in individual cells in their native spatial context. However, these approaches have complementary limitations: genomics approaches report an average over many cells, which masks heterogeneity and spatial complexity in populations, whereas single-cell methods have been limited to the study of a few genes at a time.To unify the two approaches, we propose to use super-resolution microscopy to bring genomics into single cells. SRM11,12,13,14 has been a powerful tool for cell biology and can resolve subcellular structures down to 10\u201320 nm. This extraordinary resolution can be harnessed for systems biology: for the typical yeast cell of 100 \u03bcm3, the 10\u201320 nm resolution of SRM translates into \u223c108 independent volume elements (voxels) per cell. These voxels provide enough space to detect large numbers of fluorophore-based barcodes attached to molecular species. Abundances of each molecule can be quantified by counting the number of times the corresponding barcode is observed in the super-resolution image of the cell, in the native cellular and intercellular contexts.To test the feasibility of this approach, we performed proof-of-principle experiments to detect multiple mRNA species in single S. cerevisiae cells. We based our approach on the single-molecule FISH (smFISH) technique15,16. We used smFISH to combinatorially barcode transcripts, taking advantage of the high labeling specificity of oligonucleotide probes. We used two different barcoding strategies: spatial and spectral. The first relied on the spatial ordering of fluorophores from many small oligonucleotide probes bound to transcripts. The second relied only on the combination of colors used in the probes. Although the first strategy allows higher multiplexing, the second strategy is less technically demanding and more robust. We therefore used spectral barcoding to profile transcripts from 32 stress-responsive genes in single S. cerevisiae cells to test the method. In comparison to previous multiplex FISH approaches that labeled chromosomal loci and transcriptional active sites17,18 our approach directly barcoded single mRNAs.ResultsSpatial coding of single mRNAsThe first strategy we explored for combinatorial labeling directly resolved the spatial ordering of different fluorescent oligonucleotide probes on individual mRNAs. As 20-mer probes are \u223c7 nm long, multiple regions of the mRNA to which 4\u20135 probes are hybridized and are separated by 100 nucleotides can in principle be resolved by SRM with its 10\u201320 nm resolution. By hybridizing probes labeled with different fluorophores to mRNA in a specific pattern, a nanoscopic barcode can be imparted on each transcript and resolved by SRM (Fig. 1).Figure 1: Spatial ordering of fluorophores on mRNAs can be resolved by Gaussian centroid localization.(a) Fluorescence images of PUN1 probes hybridized in a single budding yeast cell, shown for each channel. (b) Schematic of labeled 25-mer oligonucleotides hybridized to PUN1 mRNA. (c) Reconstructions of centroids in boxed regions 1 and 2 in a after localization by Gaussian fitting and image alignment. (d) Percentage of co-localized PUN1 probes labeled with all three fluorophores that can be reconstructed in a with the intended fluorophore order: blue, magneta, green (n = 28, correct order of fluorophores = 74 \u00b1 8%, s.e.m.). (e) Schematic of the probe set hybridized to GFP mRNA with different order and distances between probe positions compared to fluorophore positions shown in b. (f) Representative Gaussian fitting reconstruction of probe set in e. (g) Distance between the fluorophore positions (d1 = 27.93 \u00b1 14 nm, d2 = 56 \u00b1 33 nm; \u00b1s.d.) as determined by Gaussian fitting is proportional to the intramolecular distance between barcode positions (190 bp and 350 bp). (h) Frequency of barcode identification for this probe set (n = 327, correct order = 76 \u00b1 2%, s.e.m.).Full size imageWe targeted the PUN1 mRNA in single S. cerevisiae cells with three sets of oligo probes labeled with different fluorophores. We tiled these probes along the mRNA in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 spatially ordered fashion. Hybridized mRNAs appeared as co-localized and diffraction-limited spots (Fig. 1a). We observed that 96 \u00b1 2% (n = 29 molecules, \u00b1s.e.m.) of spots that appeared in Alexa Fluor 594, Cy5 and Cy3 detection channels also co-localized among all three channels, indicating efficient hybridization of the PUN1 probes. We found that different probe sets hybridized with similar efficiency. We quantified the hybridization efficiency of individual FISH probes of the CMK2 probeset to be Hindividual = 67.5 \u00b1 9.1% by photobleaching (Supplementary Fig. 1, n = 173, \u00b1s.e.m.). The effective hybridization efficiency of the barcode, or the probability that at least one probe hybridized for each coding position is Hbarcode = (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 Hsingle)R)N, where R is the probe redundancy at each coding position, and N is the number of coding positions. With four probes in each barcode-coding position, the labeling efficiency was 99% for each position, giving a 96% coincidence rate for all three coding positions.The position of labeled probes on mRNA can be determined to a much higher resolution by Gaussian fitting19,20 of the co-localized spots. We observed the correct spatial order in 74 \u00b1 8% (n = 28, \u00b1s.e.m.) of the mRNA that were hybridized by probes labeled with all three fluorophores after alignment of the imaging channels. Error in detecting correct fluorophore order in the barcode (26%) may result from a combination of factors, including localization error, lack of z-dimension resolution and mRNA secondary structure (Supplementary Note). Barcode readout fidelity was robust to switching the barcode order (Fig. 1e\u2013h), independent of mRNA identity (Supplementary Figs. 2\u20134).Super-resolution imaging of mRNA barcodesBarcoding with conventional fluorescence microscopy is only useful in cases where transcript levels are low. When the density of transcripts is high, diffraction-limited fluorescence spots of the same color will overlap and make barcode readout impossible. Super-resolution imaging using sparse activation of subsets of overlapping fluorophores is essential for high-density multiplex barcoding when signals from multiple transcripts overlap.To perform super-resolution barcoding, we turned to stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging with cyanine dye\u2013based photoswitchable dye pairs21. We used singly labeled probes that only generated photoswitchable pairs when an emitter-labeled and an activator-labeled oligonucleotide probe hybridized next to one another on the mRNA (Fig. 2a,b). As both probes are required for the fluorophore to be reactivated, background is dramatically reduced because nonspecifically bound emitter probes cannot reactivate. We used the activator-emitter dye pairs to construct our barcodes, with Cy5, Alexa Fluor 680 and Alexa Fluor 750 as emitters (Supplementary Fig. 5) and Alexa Fluor 405, FITC and Cy3 as activators21.Figure 2: Super-resolution imaging enables combinatorial labeling of individual transcripts.(a) Each probe pair consisted of an activator-labeled and an emitter-labeled oligonucleotide probe hybridized adjacent to each other. (b) Schematic of colors used for barcoding, each of which results from an oligo labeled with an activator (Alexa Fluor 405 (A405), Alexa Fluor 488 (A488) and Cy3) binding adjacent to an oligo labeled with an emitter (Cy5, Alexa Fluor 680 (A680) and Alexa Fluor 750 (A750)). (c,d) PUN1 mRNA (c) and YPS1 mRNA (d) three-position spatial barcode, with the schematic (top) illustrating the order of colors in the barcode, each of which results from four sets of pairs of probes labeled with emitter-activator pairs as indicated in b. In the localization scatterplot (bottom) each dot represents an activation of a fluorophore pair. (e) RCN2 mRNA spectral three-color barcode; probes hybridize throughout the mRNA (top). Localization scatterplots are as in c. Number of integrated peak pixel counts throughout the STORM movie detected for each fluorophore pair is plotted in histograms. Cy5-A405, Cy5-A488, Cy5-Cy3 and A750-Cy3 were detected with 6195, 471, 6881 and 235 integrated counts, respectively. Cy5-A488 (asterisk) was present due to cross-talk from Cy5-Cy3 and was rejected based on the threshold measurements in Supplementary Figure 10. Note that the A750-based dye pairs give fewer photons than Cy5 dye pairs but were readily detected with less cross-talk. (f) YLR194C mRNA spectral three-color barcode. Cy5-A488, Cy5-Cy3, A750-Cy3 and A680-Cy3 were detected with 773, 999, 130 and 92 integrated peak counts, respectively. A680-Cy3 (asterisk) was due to cross-talk from Cy5-Cy3 and was rejected.Full size imageWe labeled the PUN1 mRNA (Fig. 2c) using Cy5-based probe pairs. Each probe pair was repeated four times per code position, ensuring a high frequency of hybridized probe-pair formation. With four probe pairs per barcode position, we observed that all three positions of the barcode were present at a rate of 61 \u00b1 8% (n = 85, s.e.m.), consistent with the theoretical hybridization efficiency of Hsuperbar = 75% (Supplementary Note and Fig. 1). Hybridization efficiency can be improved by using a higher redundancy in coding: for example, with six probe pairs per barcode position, the hybridization rate can be increased to 92% for a three-position barcode. Of the barcodes that completely hybridized, we identified the correct barcode order by STORM imaging 72 \u00b1 10% (n = 50, s.e.m.) of the time. This was consistent with results obtained using non-photoswitchable fluorophores and independent of mRNA species (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138).For two-dimensional (2D) imaging the spatial barcoding scheme necessitates the linearization of mRNA. To do so, we compressed cells between coverglass slips, extending the mRNA using the lateral force of compression. Such treatment can be readily applied to single-cell organisms and embryos but may destroy spatially complex samples (Supplementary Note).The principal drawback of spatial barcoding is its high-resolution requirement. It is difficult to use dyes that emit fewer photons, such as Alexa Fluors 680 and 750, when high (\u223c20 nm) intramolecular resolution is necessary. We anticipate that the continued development of improved fluorophores, 3D microscopy and nucleic acid self-assembly22 will enable spatial coding to reach its full potential. In the meantime an alternative strategy, which we call spectral barcoding, is more appropriate for most applications.Spectral codingIn spectral barcoding (Fig. 2e,f) the mRNA is identified by the combination of hybridized fluorophore-labeled probes, ignoring spatial order. As long as all the fluorophore pairs are present (as determined by the integrated photon counts over the STORM imaging cycle) and can be identified above the cross-talk tolerances, the barcode assignment can be made confidently even if the total amount of collected photons is low. This comparatively low resolution requirement enables the use of dim fluorophores, as probes need only to be localized to within the \u223c100 nm area of a single mRNA (Table 1). Probes labeled with the same fluorophore can be distributed throughout an mRNA, making spectral coding more robust to heterogeneities in hybridization and partial degradation of mRNA. In contrast to spatial coding, molecules do not need to be linearized to be faithfully identified, potentially permitting other molecules, such as proteins, to be multiplexed under super-resolution imaging.Table 1 Comparative advantages of SRM barcoding techniquesFull size tableProfiling stress response genes in single yeast cellsAs a proof of principle of our technique, we profiled transcripts from 32 known stress-responsive genes (Supplementary Table 1) in single S. cerevisiae cells in response to extracellular calcium stress. We have previously shown that the master transcription factor Crz1 translocates in and out of the nucleus in short (2\u20133 min) well-defined pulses in the presence of extracellular calcium23. These pulses occur stochastically in time and activate target gene expression in a probabilistic fashion. Calcium stress also triggers the Msn2 pathway, a general stress-response regulator that also translocates between the cytoplasm and nucleus in pulses23.For mRNA profiling we selected 14 genes that are regulated by Crz1, 5 general stress-response genes as well as 13 other aging and stress markers24. To ensure that we observed the products resulting from individual transcription factor translocation between the cytoplasm and nucleus in pulses, we fixed cells under conditions where the average interval between translocation pulses23 was longer than the typical mRNA lifetime.To label these mRNAs, we used spectral coding with combinations of three of seven photoswitchable dye pairs (3C7 = 35). Barcode assignments are described in Supplementary Table 1. We imaged cells hybridized with these probes by STORM and quantified transcript levels in individual cells based on the abundances of the corresponding barcodes (Supplementary Fig. 9). The main concern with multiplexing a large probe set is the cross-talk among the barcodes. This can arise from several sources: fluorescence background from the cell, blinking of nonspecifically bound probes, cross-talk among the fluorophores and errors in computational analysis. To rule out cross-talk and nonspecific blinking, we only accepted fluorophore assignments at least 3 s.d. from the measured cross-talk values (Supplementary Fig. 10). To rule out the possibility that random autofluoresence from cells would skew the measurements, we implemented an imaging scheme containing frequent frames without activation to reject high-frequency false activation (Supplementary Fig. 11). In addition, we intentionally left certain barcodes unassigned, and measured the rate of false positives from those barcodes to be 0.67 \u00b1 0.84 copies per cell (n = 62 cells, s.d.), which represents the additive noise floor of our measurements.To check the accuracy of our quantification by super-resolution barcoding, we compared the mean expression measured by spectral barcoding to quantitative (q)PCR as well as smFISH results. We obtained R2 values of 0.95 for both control techniques when compared to spectral barcoding (Fig. 3a,b). We found a twofold difference between mean copy number measured with smFISH versus with super-resolution barcodes, which can be accounted for by the hybridization efficiency of our probe set and the high threshold we used to reject false and nonspecific activation of the emitter fluorophore (Supplementary Note). For future probe-set designs, a higher redundancy in probes will considerably increase the effective hybridization rate.Figure 3: Validation of mRNA quantitation by super-resolution barcoding.(a) Comparison of smFISH results with super-resolution barcodes yielded R2 = 0.95 with a slope of 2.05. Eleven genes were targeted in the probe set, including eight Crz1-responsive genes, one Msn2 target gene, and two aging and stress genes. (b) For the qPCR experiment, eight Crz1-responsive genes were quantified. (c) Robustness of mRNA quantitation measured by two different barcoding schemes. Scheme 1 is the spectral barcoding scheme used for experiments in Figure 4 and schemes 2, for those in Supplementary Table 2. A regression with an R2 value of 0.88 was obtained after removal of the one outlier (red circle). The outlier was removed because of its high cook's distance of 2.1 (Supplementary Fig. 12).Full size imageTo determine whether a particular barcode scheme introduced appreciable bias, we compared the expression levels measured by two different scrambled barcode schemes for 20 genes (Supplementary Table 2). We measured mRNAs with a range of average copy numbers from 1 to 10 copies per cell. Some mRNAs (CMK2 and NPT1) were expressed at levels comparable to or higher than the abundant tubulin subunit genes. We did not measure the 12 remaining genes with low copy numbers (\u223c1 per cell) because they were within the false detection threshold of our measurements. Results from the two spectral barcoding schemes agreed with an R2 = 0.88 (n = 1,871 for the standard code, n = 1,523 for the switched code; Fig. 3c, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 12) for 19 of the 20 compared genes. As switching scrambled the barcode assignments for genes with different expression levels, the consistent results in this experiment showed that barcodes of high-copy-number genes did not bias the quantification of barcodes of low-copy-number genes through misidentification.Combinatorial regulation in the calcium stress networkCells often need to turn on the expression of many genes in response to external stress. We analyzed the expression of several genes in the calcium stress regulon that respond to nuclear localization pulses of the Crz1 and Msn2 transcription factors. In Figure 4, each column represents a single yeast cell grown in medium supplemented with 50 mM Ca2+ and each row represents the mRNA abundances measured for each gene. From these data it is clear that the transcriptional response to calcium varied widely among individual cells.Figure 4: Single-cell expression profiles of 32 mRNAs.(a,b) Each column corresponds to the expression profile of a single yeast cell. Cells and genes in a were clustered using agglomerative hierarchal clustering on the correlation between species using Ward's criterion. P values for secondary clusters we calculated by bootstrap resampling and are indicated adjacent to these clusters. Genes can be broadly clustered into two classes, one largely containing genes regulated by both Crz1 and Msn2 (P = 0.09, upper cluster) and one largely containing genes regulated by Crz1 (P = 0.08, lower cluster) (a). Cells are grouped in two distinct clusters, one showing correlations amongst the expression of all genes regulated by Crz1 (P = 0.2, left cluster), the other with large expression correlations among combinatorial genes (P = 0.16, right clusters). Data for additional measured genes are shown in b.Full size imageTo characterize the heterogeneity in regulon expression in single yeast cells, we first examined the variability in the abundance of each mRNA species. The distribution of expression levels for most genes included a low basal state and a long-tailed high-expression mode corresponding to bursts of transcription (Supplementary Fig. 13), similar to those observed in previous smFISH experiments in yeast25. As these bursts of transcription are triggered by a transcription-factor translocation pulse in our experiment, we asked whether for our target genes the bursts occurred synchronously. Previous two-color smFISH experiments26 in yeast found that targets of a constitutively active transcription factor in the galatcose-response network as well as metabolic genes were well correlated (R2 = 0.5\u20130.7). We found a range of correlation coefficients from \u22120.11 to 0.78 between pairs of calcium-responsive genes (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15), indicative of heterogeneous coordination throughout the regulon.Given this heterogeneous regulon expression profile, we next asked whether there were subgroups of genes that had simultaneous bursts of transcription and whether these correlated groups of genes correspond to different regulatory architectures. We resolved two distinct clusters for the Crz1-responsive genes (P = 0.09, 0.08 respectively; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 16). In the first cluster, Crz1-responsive genes were preferentially clustered based on their coexpression with Msn2-responsive genes. The promoter sequences of many of these genes, such as PUN1, YLR194C, RCN2 and NPT1, contained Msn2-binding sites along with Crz1-binding sites. Genes in the other cluster predominantly contained only Crz1-binding sites, with the exception of YPS1 and PMC1, which also contained Msn2-binding sites. The lower average correlations between Crz1-responsive genes and genes combinatorially regulated by Crz1 and Msn2 (here referred to as 'combinatorial' targets) (R2 = 0.36, s.d. = 0.16, n = 62 cells) compared to those among pure Crz1-responsive targets (R2 = 0.55, s.d. = 0.17, n = 62) or among the combinatorial targets (R2 = 0.52, s.d. = 0.11, n = 62 cells) indicated different sources of inputs on the target genes.As Crz1 and Msn2 nuclear localization pulses are not synchronized in individual cells23 at the low calcium (50 mM) levels used in this experiment, we hypothesized that the two cell clusters in the data correspond to cells responding to either a Crz1 pulse or a Msn2 pulse (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note). We tested this by knocking out the Crz1 and Msn2 pathway separately and visualizing the loss of the associated expression clusters (Supplementary Figs. 17\u201320). In cells treated with FK506, an inhibitor of the Crz1 phosphotase Calcineurin, the overall mRNA copy number was lower (Fig. 5a). Conversely, in the MSN2\u2212 and MSN4\u2212 cells, all targets genes should be expressed in response only to Crz1 translocation pulses (Supplementary Note). This is consistent with the observed coordination between pure Crz1 and combinatorial targets (Fig. 5b,c) as well as the disappearance of the cell cluster with only combinatorial targets expressed (Supplementary Fig. 18). This experiment indicates a modulatory effect for Msn2 on Crz1 target genes.Figure 5: Msn2 and Crz1 combinatorially affect target regulons.(a) Total number of regulon-specific mRNAs in single yeast cells is shown in box plots. Pure Crz1 targets were expressed in wild type (WT) and in MSN2\u2212 and MSN4\u2212 cells, but were repressed in FK506 treated cells. Wild-type cells clustered into two groups (Fig. 4a), wild-type cell cluster 1 and wild-type cell cluster 2, corresponding to cells with high nuclear concentration of Crz1 or Msn2, respectively. Combinatorial targets are repressed in the MSN2\u2212 and MSN4\u2212 as well as in FK506-treated cells. All data in this analysis are for genes listed in Figure 4a (genes analyzed in Fig. 4b were not included in these analyses). (b,c) Averaged correlation coefficients between pairs of genes in the combinatorial or only Crz1 target clusters.Full size imageDiscussionSuper-resolution barcoding can be dramatically scaled up with the technique we presented here. We found that the typical transcript size was about 100 nm and that transcripts were uniformly random distributed in yeast cells (Supplementary Fig. 21) at a mean density of 1.9 \u00b1 1.5 barcodes \u03bcm\u22122 (n = 2463, s.d.). There were local regions that contained multiple mRNA barcodes in a diffraction-limited spot (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Note) necessitating the use of super-resolution imaging. However, globally, super-resolution barcodes of the 32 profiled genes occupy less than 2% of the 2D super-resolution space available in a yeast cell, leaving a large amount of space open for additional multiplexing. With one of the additional available emitters27, 12C5 = 792 genes can be spectrally coded.Spectral barcoding has a reconstruction fidelity dependent only on the binding of fluorophore-labeled probes, does not require linearization of the coded molecule, has a low photon requirement and allows the molecule of interest to be labeled in a distributed pattern to increase robustness. These advantages make it an excellent technique for barcoding mRNA and other molecules with unknown structures with the existing SRM dye palette. In comparison, spatial barcoding has a localized hybridization pattern, a lower reconstruction fidelity owing to the much higher photon requirements and the tertiary structure of the barcoded molecule. It has the advantage of scaling and may be more applicable to chromosome and splice isoform barcoding.Scaling up beyond 1,000 genes will require the implementation of 3D SRM28 to improve the axial resolution by a factor of 20 and the synthesis of an additional far-infrared fluorophore as an emitter (to spectrally code 18C6 = 18,532 genes). At this higher barcode density, more sophisticated computational algorithms will also be necessary to identify barcodes in an intelligent and automatic fashion (Supplementary Note).Super-resolution barcoding provides several advantages over existing transcriptional profiling techniques. First, direct imaging of the sample preserves the spatial information both within cells and among cells. With the application of light-sheet microscopy29, this technique can be extended to analyze optically thick samples without photobleaching associated with z-dimension sectioning in epi-fluorescence microscopy. This advantage makes it a powerful tool in studying signaling in heterogeneous systems such as microbial ecosystems, tissue and embryos, where interactions among different cellular populations have an essential role in cellular decisions. Second, because of the single-molecule and in situ nature of the technique, the method is quantitative and avoids intrinsic bias in RNA extraction and conversion to cDNA. Third, many cells can be imaged simultaneously under a microscope quickly, and throughput can be scaled up without considerable costs, compared to the high cost and long waiting time for sequencing nucleic acid from single cells. After the initial cost of the probe-set synthesis, the probe set can be hybridized many thousands of times in wild-type and mutant organisms. Super-resolution barcoding even at its current throughput can be a useful follow-up to existing high-throughput transcriptomics techniques by allowing genes of interest to be monitored with single-cell resolution in spatially complex samples.This labeling scheme can be applied to many types of molecules in situ. It is a short leap to consider combinatorial labeling of chromosomes and proteins30 for single-cell proteomics and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. We hypothesize that for many types of biochemical techniques, such as microarrays, there is an equivalent in situ single-cell experiment possible through super-resolution barcoding, removing the need for spatial separation traditionally performed using gels or dilution on a chip.MethodsProbe design, purification and hybridization.We designed 25-mer oligonucleotide probes (Biosearch) to have the same melting temperature whenever possible (Supplementary Table 3). FISH probes were designed with 2-base-pair spacing between probes to allow efficient reactivation of the pair dyes, often leading to varying melting temperature of probes. Alexa Fluor 405, Alexa Fluor 488 and Cy3 were used as the activators, and Cy5, Alexa Fluor 680 and Alexa Fluor 750 (Invitrogen) as the switchable dye. Probes were labeled and purified following the protocol in ref. 16. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium with 50 mM CaCl2 and fixed in log growth phase. Cells were also treated with 0.1% NaBH4 for 30 min before the ethanol-permeabilization step. We found the NaBH4 treatment decreased the autofluorescence background of fixed yeast cells. Cells were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in Eppendorf tubes and aliquoted out for hybridization experiments. Cells were hybridized with the probes overnight at room temperature in 20% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. For all smFISH experiments, 12 probes (Supplementary Table 3) were hybridized to mRNA. For super-resolution barcoding, sets of 4\u20137 probe pairs were used for Cy5, A680 and A750, respectively. After hybridization, cells were washed in 10% formamide and 0.2\u00d7 SSC solution 3 times and imaged.Imaging.For conventional epi-fluorescence microscopy, images were acquired on an Olympus IX81 with a 100\u00d7 sapo objective with laser illumination at 532 nm, 594 nm and 640 nm. Images were acquired with Micromanager software and an Andor Ikon-M DU934 BV charge-coupled device (CCD). Conventional fluorescence images were acquired in three different fluorescence channels (Semrock zero-line filters). The centroids of the diffraction-limited FISH spots were calculated in each channel, and the images were aligned by center of mass alignment of co-localized fluorescence spots between channels. This was sufficient for alignment without correcting for rotation and dilation.Super-resolution imaging was performed on a Nikon TI-eclipse microscope with PFS autofocus lock. Standard super-resolution imaging buffers with glucose oxidase and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol were used13. The imaging lasers, a 640-nm laser along with a 30-mW 691-nm and a 30-mW 730-nm laser (Coherent Lasers) were brought to the sample through a Nikon Apo total internal reflection (TIR) 100\u00d7 objective. The 405-nm, 473-nm and 556-nm lasers were used as activation lasers, and imaging automation was controlled by Micromanager software. Two illumination pathways were used on the microscope: an imaging pathway containing the 640-nm, 691-nm and 730-nm lasers, and an activation pathway consisting of the remaining lasers. The activation pathway contained an automated filter wheel (Thorlabs) with neutral density (ND) filters 0.3, 0.6, 1 and 1.6 and an Uniblitz shutter, enabling automatic control of activation power by a custom written Micromanager script. No excitation filters were used in the microscope, enabling both activation and imaging wavelengths to reach the sample. Exposure times for all STORM movies were 150 ms for Cy5, 400 ms for A680 and 300 ms for A750.For all STORM experiments, the imaging routine was designed to minimize cross-talk and photobleaching. To reduce activator cross-talk, every imaging routine sequentially used activation lasers from 556 nm, to 473 nm, to 405 nm. As the absorption spectra of the activator dyes slightly overlap, this allowed us to minimize cross-activation by preferentially bleaching the overlapping dye before the routine reached the adjacent activation laser.For the spatial coding images, samples were first imaged with only the 640-nm laser for 100 frames to switch off Cy5 and to determine the nonspecific blinking rate. Then, 100 frames were acquired in each activation channel by illumination with the activation and the imaging lasers. This reduced the cross-talk among the different activation channels.For the spectral coding images, the samples were first bleached in all imaging channels for six frames. Samples were imaged in order of the activators, starting at 556 nm to 473 nm and then 405 nm. For the 556-nm laser activation, the microscope first imaged the 730-nm laser followed by either the 640-nm or 691-nm laser for 48 cycles. This pattern minimized the Cy5 and A680 signal loss due to bleaching of both dyes by the 640-nm and 691-nm lasers. For the remaining activation lasers, the microscope cyclically imaged the 730-nm laser followed by the 640-nm laser. Samples were only illuminated with activation light in the A750 channel. This imaging pattern minimized photobleaching of A750 while still allowing us to observe adequate activation of the A680 and Cy5 probe pairs. Throughout the imaging routine, for every four cycles of the imaging lasers, two cycles without the activator lasers were acquired. This enabled us to rule out much of the false positive and nonspecific blinking events in the images. Activation powers were selected to maximize activation rate while avoiding cross-talk among the activators. After the imaging cycle with all emitters, the 640-nm laser was continuously used to image Cy5 for another 30 frames of specific activation with an ND filter added to the pathway to bring the activation laser power to 50% of the original activation. The acquisition sequence is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 11.The activation lasers were controlled by an Arudino microcontroller board and a servo motor shutter. Fluorescent beads (Invitrogen F-8810) were used as fiducial markers to correct for stage drifts. The microscope stages (Prior and ASI) were automated and controlled by acquisition software to enable multiposition imaging.Analysis.Images from diffraction-limited and super-resolution experiments were analyzed with a custom written Mathematica script, available upon request. In the analysis, the beads were first aligned to determine the stage drifts. Beads emit on the order of 50,000 photons per image, and could be localized to a few nanometers. Beads close to the cells were eliminated from analysis as the switching of fluorophores in cells can disrupt the bead alignment. Then, fluorophores were selected from each image by intensity thresholding (600 photons for Cy5, 400 photons for A680 and 250 photons for A750), and their centroid was calculated by Gaussian fitting. We did not reject activation events that involved multiple fluorophores in the analysis because they came predominantly from single clusters and allowed us to preserve more of the photons collected for the analysis. In principle, multiple activation frames can be compared to neighboring frames to extract localization information.To determine which of the barcode colors are present instead of nonspecific activation, we compared the number of activation events occurring in the specific activation channel versus the activations observed in frames with no activation. If the frequency of nonspecific activation events exceeded that of specific activation events, then that channel was rejected. As several of the activators and emitter channels can cross-talk into other channels, we quantified the cross-talk ratio and rejected activation events if they fell below our thresholds (Supplementary Note). Switching events that spatially clustered together were grouped to display the resolved barcode. For spectral barcodes, activations were clustered together on a 184-nm grid for simplicity because most RNAs were contained within a diameter of 100 nm. Activation events near grid vertices were assigned to a neighboring region containing localizations of the same fluorophore pair. For three-color spatial barcodes, the center color was determined by finding the position that was not one of the two localized colors separated by the longest distance. Cell positions were determined by manual segmentation. Barcodes were collected and tabulated for each single cell. Cross-correlation was calculated using the correlation function in Mathematica, and the standard errors were calculated from resampling the data 100 times.Quantitative PCR measurements.For real-time PCR experiments, S. cerevisiae were grown in YPD medium and were induced with 50 mM CaCl2 for 2 h. The cells were then spheroplasted with zymolyase, RNase inhibitor and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The RNA was isolated using the Trizol Plus RNA Purification System (Invitrogen). The extract was treated with recombinant DNase I (Roche) to digest genomic DNA. Reverse transcription of the RNA was performed using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of the resulting cDNA were diluted 1:10 and 1:100 with water. QPCR was performed using Maxima Sybr Green and Flourescein qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) on a Bio-Rad CFX machine. QPCR was performed on each gene with the undiluted cDNA, 1:10 dilution cDNA and 1:100 dilution cDNA, with each dilution repeated in triplicate (Fig. 3). The PCR efficiency for each gene was calculated from a linear fit of the three dilution points. RNA abundance was determined from the amplification efficiency.

Many biological processes of interest occur in optically opaque or physically inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches other than direct imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system that enables cells to record lineage information and event histories in the genome in a format that can be subsequently read out of single cells in situ. This system, termed memory by engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout (MEMOIR), is based on a set of barcoded recording elements termed scratchpads. The state of a given scratchpad can be irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis, and later read out in single cells through multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we engineered mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and other recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were altered in a progressive and stochastic fashion as the cells proliferated. Analysis of the final states of scratchpads in single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage information from cell colonies. Combining analysis of endogenous gene expression with lineage reconstruction in the same cells further allowed inference of the dynamic rates at which embryonic stem cells switch between two gene expression states. Finally, using simulations, we show how parallel MEMOIR systems operating in the same cell could enable recording and readout of dynamic cellular event histories. MEMOIR thus provides a versatile platform for information recording and in situ, single-cell readout across diverse biological systems.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainSomatic mutations occur stochastically and independently in different cells, and are inherited from one cell generation to the next. They can therefore leave a record of lineage relationships, or other information, in the genomes of related cells. Pioneering work showed that sequencing can be used to identify somatic mutations and thereby recover lineage information1,2,3,4,5,6. However, sequencing has generally required disrupting the spatial context of cells, and somatic mutations are distributed throughout the genome, hindering their identification and analysis. Two recent advances together enable an alternative approach. First, CRISPR/Cas9 (refs 7, 8, 9) can target mutagenesis to specific genomic elements, facilitating the continuous and controlled generation of stochastic genetic variation at designated genomic regions. Second, in situ single cell analysis by sequential smFISH10,11(seqFISH) allows genetic information to be directly interrogated in a highly multiplexed fashion in individual cells within native tissue. Together, these techniques could in principle permit recording and in situ readout of genetic changes at specific loci for lineage reconstruction and event recording.To implement such a system, we devised a bipartite genetic recording element termed the \u2018barcoded scratchpad\u2019. The state of this scratchpad can be stochastically altered in live cells and read out in situ in single cells by smFISH (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a). The scratchpad element consists of 10 repeat units12. gRNA targeting of Cas9 to the scratchpad generates double-strand breaks that result in its deletion, or \u2018collapse\u2019. (Fig. 1a, b). Adjacent to each scratchpad, we incorporated a co-transcribed barcode (Supplementary Table 1). The barcode and scratchpad components can each be identified using specific sets of smFISH probes (Supplementary Table 2), and thus serve as an addressable \u2018bit\u2019.Figure 1: The MEMOIR system for recording and in situ readout of cell lineage.a, Barcoded scratchpads provide a general purpose recording element whose state can be irreversibly altered by Cas9/gRNA-mediated cleavage. b, The MEMOIR recording system consists of three types of components, all stably integrated into the genome: (1) a Cas9 variant containing an inducible degron (DD) that is stabilized by the small molecule Shield1. (2) A Wnt-inducible gRNA targeting the scratchpad, co-expressed with a fluorescent protein (mTurquoise). Ribozyme sequences (HH, HDV) enable gRNA excision. (3) A set of barcoded scratchpads (two-colour elements) integrated throughout the genome. Inverted triangles in a and b denote PiggyBac terminal repeats, used for genome integration. c, The MEMOIR recording and readout process. During recording, scratchpads collapse stochastically as cells proliferate, producing distinct scratchpad states in each cell. During readout, individual mRNA molecules are detected with a single scratchpad-specific probe set (orange, inset), and multiple barcode-specific probe sets (blue, green, inset) through sequential rounds of hybridization and imaging. Uncollapsed scratchpads produce co-localized barcode and scratchpad signals (overlapping dots), while collapsed scratchpads produce only a barcode-specific signal (single dots).\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageUsing a pool of such barcoded scratchpads enables lineage recording and readout through a two-step process. During cell proliferation, Cas9 generates gradual and stochastic accumulation of collapsed scratchpads in each cell lineage. Subsequently, cells can be fixed and analysed by seqFISH to identify barcodes and assess their states based on the presence or absence of a co-localized scratchpad signal (Fig. 1c).To implement the MEMOIR system, we engineered a stable mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line, designated MEM-01, incorporating barcoded scratchpads, Cas9, and a scratchpad-targeting gRNA (Fig. 1b). First, we used PiggyBac transposition13 to integrate a set of 28 barcoded scratchpad elements into the genome. We identified a clone in which 13 different barcodes were highly expressed (Extended Data Fig. 1b\u2013d). Within this line, we stably integrated a Cas9 variant containing an inducible degron to allow external modulation of Cas9 activity14. Finally, we engineered a scratchpad-targeting gRNA expressed from a Wnt-regulated promoter15(Methods), to enable both external control as well as recording of Wnt pathway activity.Using this cell line, we verified that smFISH could detect scratchpad collapse. After 48 h of Cas9 and gRNA induction, we observed a substantial loss of scratchpad smFISH signal, but not barcode signal (Fig. 2a, b, Extended Data Fig. 2). By contrast, in cells in which MEMOIR recording was not induced, co-localization between barcode and scratchpad signals was observed in approximately 90% of the transcripts, consistent with expected smFISH accuracies16,17(Fig. 2b, c). Although individual barcoded scratchpad transcripts appeared either collapsed or uncollapsed based on co-localization, cells typically exhibited a mixture of collapsed and uncollapsed scratchpads with the same barcode owing to the existence of multiple genomic integrations undergoing independent collapse events (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Together, these results indicate that scratchpad states can be altered and that the fraction of collapsed scratchpads for each barcode can be subsequently read out in situ.Figure 2: In situ readout of scratchpad state.a, smFISH readout of scratchpad state in two cells (white outlines). The scratchpad associated with barcode 2 has collapsed in the lower cell, but remains uncollapsed in the upper cell. Overlaid images are slightly offset for visual clarity. b, Histograms of scratchpad smFISH signal intensities, identified as collapsed (blue) or uncollapsed (orange) based on scratchpad\u2013barcode co-localization. The fraction of collapsed scratchpads increased after 48\u2009h of activation (top versus bottom panel). Far right bars indicate smFISH signal exceeding the maximum displayed intensity. c, Scratchpad collapse accumulates over time post activation.

Activated samples in b and c only include gRNA-expressing cells, as measured by co-expression of mTurquoise. d, Multiplexed readout of barcoded scratchpads (scratchpad, SP; barcode, BC) by sequential rounds of hybridization with distinct probe sets (colours) provide information about the collapse status of multiple barcoded scratchpads in each cell (right). e, Example of seqFISH analysis. Scratchpads (red) and three pairs of barcodes (middle images) are shown (pseudocoloured). Solid and dashed circles at barcode positions indicate uncollapsed and collapsed scratchpads, respectively. Barcode data are superimposed on the scratchpad image in the final panel. For clarity, additional hybridizations and barcodes are not shown. Scale bars (a, e), 10\u2009\u03bcm (left images) and 2\u2009\u03bcm (magnified panels).\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageThe fraction of collapsed scratchpads increased progressively over time after Cas9 and gRNA induction, as required for MEMOIR operation. We observed an approximately 27% decrease in mean co-localization fraction after 48\u2009h of Cas9 and gRNA induction (Fig. 2b, c). Additionally, the collapse rate correlated with the level of gRNA expression, suggesting that collapse rates are tuneable (Extended Data Fig. 2d). By contrast, in the absence of induction, scratchpad states remained stable (Extended Data Fig. 2e\u2013g). Further, a Cre-activated gRNA functioned similarly to the Wnt-activated gRNA (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013d), and scratchpad collapse also occurred in CHO-K1 cells and budding yeast (Extended Data Fig. 3e, f), suggesting that the system design can be generalized to other methods of activation and to other species. Finally, we verified that seqFISH could enable readout of 13 distinct barcoded scratchpads in single cells using 7 rounds of hybridization (Fig. 2d, e; Methods).To analyse cell lineage, we activated MEMOIR and allowed cells to grow for 3 or 4 generations, while performing time-lapse imaging to establish an independent \u2018ground truth\u2019 lineage for later validation (Fig. 3a). We then fixed the cells and analysed their barcoded scratchpads by seqFISH (Fig. 3b). Altogether, we analysed 108 colonies, including 836 cells.Figure 3: MEMOIR enables lineage reconstruction in ES cell colonies.a, Time-lapse videos of colony growth were acquired to provide lineage \u2018ground truth\u2019 (dashed lines) for later validation of reconstructed lineages, but not for reconstruction itself. b, At the end of the movie, seqFISH was performed, as in Fig. 2. Scale bar, 20\u2009\u03bcm. c, Examples of how barcoded scratchpad collapse patterns reflect cell lineage. d, MEMOIR readout for the colony in a\u2013c, showing the number of barcode transcripts detected (bubble size) and the uncollapsed fraction (colour scale). e, Data from d were used to compute a matrix of cell-to-cell barcode \u2018distance\u2019 (dissimilarity) scores. f, Reconstructed lineage tree for the same colony (Methods). Percentages on the tree represent the frequencies of clade occurrence from a barcode resampling bootstrap procedure. In this case, the reconstructed tree matches that obtained from the video. g, Cumulative distributions show the fraction of all pairwise relationships correctly identified in each colony, for all colonies, and for the top 20% (subset 1) or 40% (subset 2) ranked by bootstrap score. h, Idealized simulations of three-generation binary trees show how reconstruction accuracy (fraction of relationships correctly identified, colour) depends on collapse rate and number of scratchpads. i, Cumulative distributions from simulations of MEMOIR show how empirically measured noise sources affect reconstruction accuracy in simulated trees, assuming 13 scratchpads. gRNA and Cas9 expression noise adds some reconstruction error (dotted line), which is strongly increased by additional noise from scratchpad expression variability, assuming two expressed integrations per barcode (dashed line), and increased slightly more by addition of smFISH readout noise (solid line).\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageInspection of scratchpad collapse patterns revealed lineage information. For example, in one colony, barcode 9 was differentially collapsed between two 4-cell clades, consistent with a collapse event occurring after the first cell division (Fig. 3c, left). Similarly, barcode 2 revealed distinct collapse frequencies between first cousins, but similar frequencies between sister cell pairs (Fig. 3c, middle). Barcode 10 provided additional lineage information, as different sister cell pairs showed collapse frequencies that were similar to each other but different from their cousins (Fig. 3c, right). These examples, along with others (Extended Data Figs 4 and 5), show how scratchpad collapse patterns can provide insight into lineage relationships.To analyse lineage reconstruction more systematically, we tabulated scratchpad collapse frequencies for all probed barcodes in each colony (Fig. 3d) and used these data to calculate a cell-to-cell \u2018distance\u2019 matrix, representing differences in collapse patterns between each pair of cells (Fig. 3e; Supplementary Information). We then applied a binary hierarchical clustering algorithm adapted from phylogenetic analysis to these distance scores in order to reconstruct a lineage tree18,19(Fig. 3f; see Methods). Finally, as validation, we compared each reconstructed tree to the actual colony lineage obtained directly from the corresponding time-lapse video (Fig. 3a).Across all 108 colonies, we observed a broad distribution of reconstruction fidelity (Fig. 3g, all colonies). However, using a bootstrap procedure to rank colonies based on the robustness of reconstruction to resampling of the underlying data, it was possible to identify colonies with more informative scratchpad collapse patterns, and these tended to reconstruct with higher accuracy (Extended Data Fig. 6; Methods). For example, within the top 20% of colonies ranked by bootstrap, 72% of lineage relationships were correctly reconstructed (Fig. 3g, subset 1 and Extended Data Fig. 6a).To compare these results to theoretical expectations, we simulated idealized MEMOIR operation in three-generation binary trees (Methods). As expected, mean reconstruction fidelity increased with the number of distinct scratchpads and required relatively few scratchpads to reach high fidelity. For example, fidelity was  (mean and 68% central confidence interval) for 10 scratchpads and  for 20 scratchpads at the experimentally measured collapse rate of approximately 0.1 per scratchpad per cell generation (Fig. 3h). With around eight scratchpads, the performance of these idealized simulations matched that of the bootstrap selected colonies (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 6b, subset 1), consistent with the majority of the 13 barcoded scratchpads targeted by seqFISH providing useful information. The diversity of states generated corresponds to approximately 28\u2009=\u2009256 scratchpad configurations, comparable to the number of distinguishable alleles observed by sequencing-based approaches20.The current implementation of MEMOIR exhibited limited reconstruction depth and accuracy. To understand the relevant sources of error, we performed more detailed simulations, incorporating empirical measurements of noise in both recording (Cas9 and gRNA expression) and readout (for example, scratchpad expression and smFISH detection) (Extended Data Fig. 7). Notably, stochasticity in Cas9 and gRNA expression, as well as smFISH detection, contributed relatively minor errors in reconstruction. Rather, for a given number of scratchpads, the primary sources of error in reconstruction were stochastic fluctuations in scratchpad expression, and ambiguities introduced due to multiple incorporations of the same barcoded scratchpad (Fig. 3i, Extended Data Fig. 7; Supplementary Information). On the basis of this analysis, future versions of MEMOIR can be improved by increasing the number of unique scratchpad variants and reducing noise in their expression (see Supplementary Information for further discussion of potential improvements). These improvements should enable MEMOIR to reconstruct deeper and/or more sparsely sampled trees (Extended Data Figs 8 and 9).Because MEMOIR is compatible with same-cell measurements of endogenous gene expression through additional rounds of smFISH, it can provide both lineage and endpoint cell state information for the same colony. This combination can provide insight into the dynamics of switching between gene expression states (Fig. 4a). For example, ES cells stochastically transition among states with distinct expression levels of the pluripotency regulator Esrrb21,22. To infer the rates of these transitions, we measured Esrrb expression, and assigned each cell a probability of being in a high or low Esrrb expression state23,24(Fig. 4b; Supplementary Information). Using the MEMOIR-inferred lineage, we found that sisters or first cousins were significantly more likely to appear in the same Esrrb expression state compared with pairs of second cousins (P\u2009<\u20090.004) (Fig. 4c, d). Using a dynamic inference framework24,25, we further inferred the quantitative rates of switching between states (Fig. 4d, right panel, and Extended Data Fig. 10; Supplementary Information), and verified that they were consistent with direct measurements of switching dynamics23. Going forward, multiplexed in situ transcriptional profiling of endogenous genes10,11, together with MEMOIR, should enable analysis of more complex dynamic cell state transition processes.Figure 4: MEMOIR enables inference of gene expression dynamics and the recording of cellular events.a\u2013d, Gene expression dynamics inference (see Supplementary Information). a, The rates of switching between two gene expression states can be inferred by combining reconstructed lineage information and endpoint gene expression measurements (schematic). Inference works because switching rates affect the degree of cell state clustering on endpoints of lineage trees24,25. This analysis can be performed for multiple genes (red, green, blue), which could exhibit different dynamics, as shown schematically. b, Fits to the bimodal distribution of single-cell Esrrb transcript counts enable probabilistic assignment of cells to either the low (E\u2212) or high (E+) Esrrb expression state. c, Esrrb expression states mapped onto endpoints of lineage trees reconstructed by MEMOIR suggest that these states are stable for multiple generations.

Specifically, orthogonal gRNAs expressed from signal-specific promoters can in principle record multiple intracellular signals onto distinct sets of scratchpads. We simulated binary trees of six generations in which different cell lineages experienced distinct time courses of two input signals (Fig. 4g). In these simulations, one gRNA variant was constitutively expressed solely to enable lineage reconstruction using one set of scratchpads. In addition, each of the signals activated expression of a corresponding gRNA variant, generating collapse events in its own specific set of 50 scratchpads, at a rate proportional to the signal magnitude. By analysing endpoint scratchpad collapse patterns for all three sets of scratchpads, we were able to reconstruct both lineage trees and event histories (Fig. 4e\u2013g; Methods). This reconstruction process takes advantage of the reconstructed lineage tree to map the most likely assignment of collapse events from the signal-recording gRNAs to specific positions on the lineage tree, with a maximum possible time resolution of one cell cycle (since the sequence of collapse events within a cell cycle cannot be distinguished). Thus, over timescales of multiple cell cycles, MEMOIR should enable analysis of the sequence, duration, and magnitude of signals along individual cell lineages (Fig. 4g).Using genomic DNA as a writable and readable recording medium within living cells is a long-standing goal of synthetic biology26,27,28,29,30. A key application for this technology is to enable analysis of lineage and molecular event histories that unfold in complex and optically inaccessible developmental systems over timescales of multiple cell generations. MEMOIR provides a proof of principle, showing recording and readout of such information with endpoint single-cell in situ measurements. Importantly, the capacity of MEMOIR can be extended beyond the current demonstration using more scratchpads with improved designs and highly multiplexed seqFISH10,11. Thus, we anticipate this approach will open up new ways of studying developmental trajectories in developing embryos, tumours, and other systems, eventually enabling us to read, within their native spatial contexts, each cell\u2019s own individual \u2018memoir\u2019.MethodsData reportingNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments outcome assessment.MEMOIR component constructionThe scratchpad transposon was constructed from a ten-repeat array (20X PP7 stem loops) derived from plasmid pCR4-24XPP7SL12 and ligated directionally using BamH1 and BglII sites into a modified form of the PiggyBac (PB) vector PB510B (SBI) lacking the 3\u2032 insulator and including a multiple cloning site (MCS). The CMV promoter was then removed using NheI and SpeI and replaced by a PGK promoter with Gibson assembly. A gBlock (IDT) containing the AvrII and Xhol restriction sites, priming sequences, and the BGH polyA was then introduced 3\u2032 of the PP7 array by Gibson assembly using the EagI site in the backbone. Unique barcodes were then inserted into the transposon in the region 3\u2032 of the scratchpad array either by Gibson assembly or directed ligation using AvrII and XhoI. A total of 28 unique barcode sequences (Supplementary Table 1, GenScript Biotech) derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used to generate the barcoded scratchpads. Scratchpad transposons were found to produce transcripts with half-lives of approximately 2\u2009h (Extended Data Fig. 1e\u2013g).The Cas9 construct was made using hSpCas9 from pX3307. First, the FKBP degron (DD) was PCR-amplified from pBMN FKBP(DD)-YFP14 and introduced with Gibson assembly into pX330 restricted with AgeI, 5\u2032 of the open reading frame of hSpCas9, to create pX330-DD-hSpCas9. DD-hSpCas9 was amplified from this plasmid by PCR and introduced into another plasmid, 3\u2032 of a PGK promoter using Gibson assembly. After sequence verification, the PGK-DD-hSpCas9 construct was excised using restriction enzymes (AvrII and SacII), blunted with T4 polymerase, and ligated into a modified form of the PiggyBac vector PB510B (SBI) lacking the CMV promoter and including a MCS. A non-transposon version of Cas9 was also created using hSpCas9 amplified from pX330 and introduced with Gibson assembly at the 3\u2032 end of a CMV promoter containing two Tet operator sites into a standard plasmid backbone.The Wnt-pathway-responsive gRNA expression transposon was created using a LEF-1 response element15. The enhancer and promoter combination exhibited low basal activity, large dynamic range, and responsiveness to the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 and the Wnt3a ligand. This Wnt sensor was cloned upstream of a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-tagged mTurquoise2, which served as a reporter of guide expression, that contained an embedded gRNA. The gRNA was flanked by self-cleaving ribozymes to excise it from the mRNA31,32, and was purchased as a gblock (IDT) and inserted using Gibson assembly between the end of the mTurquoise2 coding sequence and a SV40 polyA. This construct was contained in a modified form of the PiggyBac vector PB510B.The Cre-activated gRNA expression transposon was created using the U6 TATA-lox promoter design33, as illustrated (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The promoter, shRNA against mTurquoise2, and gRNA regions were purchased as a gblocks or oligos (IDT) and inserted into a modified form of the PiggyBac vector PB510B containing PGK-H2B-mTurquoise2.Cell line engineering and culture conditionsTo create MEM-01 we co-transfected the E14 mouse embryonic stem cell line (ATCC cat no. CRL-1821) with expression plasmids for-hSpCas9 and the Tet repressor and then selected on neomycin. A single Cas9-positive clone was then used for co-transfection of 28 PB transposon barcoded scratchpads and a PB transposon PGK-palmitoylated-mTurquoise2/ HygroR to facilitate segmentation of cell membranes and selection on hygromycin. Subsequent scratchpad-containing clones were inspected for overall scratchpad expression by smFISH. Scratchpad clones were also assessed for Cas9 expression, which was found to be very low and heterogeneous in most clones, with no expression in many cells (for example, 6\u2009\u00b1\u200921 transcripts per cell). A scratchpad clone with good scratchpad expression was then simultaneously transfected with the DD-hSpCas9 PB transposon (to improve Cas9 expression (26\u2009\u00b1\u200917 transcripts per cell)) and the Wnt-activated gRNA expression PB transposon. Cells were selected on blasticidin. Single clones were assessed for activation potential on the basis of mTurquoise2 expression in response to CHIR99021 (Stemgent) or Wnt3a (1324-WN-002 R&D systems), and enhanced Cas9 expression was measured by smFISH. Among these clones was MEM-01, which demonstrated good gRNA activation in response to Wnt3a and increased Cas9 activity in the presence of the stabilizing agent, Shield1 (Clontech) (Extended Data Fig. 2c). MEM-01 resembled the parental E14 line in terms of cell morphology, cycle times, and expression of pluripotency markers including Esrrb, Nanog, and SSEA-1. Stably selected MEMOIR lines containing a Cre-activated gRNA were similarly engineered (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013d).The transfections described above were carried out using Fugene HD (Promega) at a mass (\u03bcg) DNA/volume (\u03bcl) Fugene ratio of 1:3 and following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For transfection of the PB components a total DNA mass of 1\u2009\u03bcg was used at a ratio of 6:1, PB transposons to PB transposase PB200PA-1 (SBI). For selection with antibiotics, transfected cells were lifted with Accutase (ThermoFisher) after transfection media was removed and plated on 100-mm plates (Nunc). 24\u2009h later growth media was replaced with selection media. Single colonies were lifted from selection plates as they matured.During standard cell culturing, ES cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in GMEM (Sigma), 15% ES cell qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco/ThermoFisher), PSG (2\u2009mM l-glutamine, 100 units per ml penicillin, 100\u2009\u03bcg ml\u22121 streptomycin) (ThermoFisher), 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate (ThermoFisher), 1,000 units per ml Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF, Millipore), 1\u00d7 Minimum Essential Medium Non-Essential Amino Acids (MEM NEAA, ThermoFisher) and 50\u2013100\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco/ThermoFisher). Cells were maintained on polystyrene (Falcon) coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma).Quantitative PCRFor detection of genomic barcode copy number, genomic DNA was prepared from cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA was quantified on a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific). Reactions were assembled as above with around 1,000\u20135,000 haploid genome copies, based on 3 picograms per haploid genome approximation. For gene expression analysis, total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was used with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For qPCR a 1:20 dilution of the cDNA was used in each reaction. All reactions were performed with IQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad). Reaction cycling was carried out on a BioRad CFX96 thermocycler. Both genomic DNA and cDNA samples were compared against Sdha copy number or expression level, respectively. Analyses included at least three biological replicates with each reaction run in triplicate, unless otherwise noted. Primer sets for all barcodes and normalizers were obtained from IDT, and the efficiencies of all primer pairs were tested.Time-lapse videos and cell culture for imagingTissue culture grade glass bottom 24-well plates (MatTek) were treated with laminin-511 (20\u2009\u03bcg ml\u22121) (Biolamina) for 4\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C and plated with cells at approximately 2,500 cells per cm2. Cells were exposed to Wnt3a (50\u2013100\u2009ng ml\u22121) and Shield1 (50\u2013100\u2009nM) at the time of plating. After approximately 16\u2009h, cells were selected for time-lapse imaging based on system activation, assessed by visible mTurquoise2 signal, and then imaged in an incubated microscope environment every 14\u2009min over 20\u201340\u2009h before being immediately fixed. Samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5\u2009min. Samples cultured for smFISH imaging, but without time-lapse video tracking, were prepared similarly (typically with a higher plated cell density) and activated for different lengths of time, as stated.Single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)Hybridization and imaging were carried out as previously described23 with the following exceptions: scratchpad transcripts were targeted with 40 DNA oligo 20mer probes and barcode regions were targeted with 18 20mer probes (Supplementary Table 2). Probes were coupled to one of three dyes (Alexa 555, 594 or 647 (ThermoFisher)) and used at approximately 130\u2009nM concentration per probe set. Post-hybridization, cells were washed in 20% formamide in 2\u00d7 SSC containing DAPI at 30\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, rinsed in 2\u00d7 SSC at room temperature, and imaged in 2\u00d7 SSC. For seqFISH, after imaging each round of hybridization, 2\u00d7 SSC was replaced with wash buffer for about 5\u2009min at room temperature and then replaced with the next probe set in hybridization buffer for overnight incubation. Most barcode signals from the previous hybridization were no longer visible during imaging of the following hybridization (owing to photobleaching and probe loss facilitated by the small number of barcode probes (18) used per barcode); any remaining visible transcripts were computationally subtracted during analysis. Incubation, washing, and imaging proceeded as above for up to nine rounds of hybridization.For analysis of smFISH images, semi-automated cell segmentation and dot detection were performed using custom Matlab software. Raw images were processed by a Laplacian of the Gaussian filter and then thresholded to select dots. Co-localization between dots in the scratchpad image and barcode image was detected if both dots were above the threshold and within a few pixels of each other. To generate the histogram of intensities for the collapsed and uncollapsed scratchpads in Fig. 2b, we integrated the fluorescence intensities in the regions of the scratchpad smFISH image that corresponded to individual barcode dots or the detected scratchpad dots, respectively. For the collapse rate experiment in Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c, we measured the aggregate smFISH scratchpad co-localization levels for four highly expressed barcodes in cells that had been induced for different lengths of time. For activating conditions shown in Fig. 2b, c, only data from cells that were actually activated (as assessed by mTurquoise2 expression) were included.Lineage reconstruction of experimental dataCell-to-cell barcode distance scores were determined for each pair of cells based on the similarity of the two cells\u2019 co-localization fractions for each barcode and weighted by the barcode\u2019s transcript number (as a measure of confidence in the observation). See Supplementary Information for details.Lineage trees were reconstructed from the cell-to-cell barcode distance matrices using a modified version of a standard agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm34. Reconstructions were constrained to binary trees such that cells were paired into sisters before first cousin pairs were assigned. Pairing proceeded by successively grouping pairs of cells or cell clusters with the minimum barcode distance. At each step, if the two most optimal (that is, minimum distance) pairings were close in distance, the algorithm optimized for the lowest combined distance of the current and next minimum distances. The distance between two clusters was computed using the standard UPGMA algorithm19 by averaging the cell-to-cell barcode distance between all possible pairs of cells across the two clusters.Bootstrap to identify robust reconstructionsFor each colony, the barcoded scratchpad data were resampled by bootstrap and corresponding lineage trees were reconstructed (n\u2009=\u20091,000 resampled reconstructions per colony). On the basis of the frequency at which the original cousin clades occurred in the resampled reconstructed trees, a robustness score was assigned to each colony. Colonies whose clade reconstructions were less sensitive to resampling showed significantly improved overall reconstruction accuracy. Subsets of colonies with more reliable reconstructions could thus be selected without prior knowledge of their accuracy by selecting colonies with higher robustness scores, for example, scores in the top 20\u201340% of the data.Alternative metrics for identifying colonies with robust lineage information were also tested. These metrics similarly enriched for subsets of data with improved reconstruction accuracy, further supporting the observation that some colonies showed clear lineage information while others did not acquire well-defined collapse patterns, probably owing to limited, excessive, or ambiguous collapse events.Lineage reconstruction simulationsTo simulate MEMOIR for three-generation binary trees, we started with one cell with a fixed number of idealized scratchpads. At each division, the daughter cells inherited the same scratchpad profile as their parent and independently collapsed each uncollapsed site with a fixed probability, defined as the collapse rate. After three generations, the scratchpad profiles of the eight resulting cells were used to reconstruct their lineage tree using either a modified neighbour joining algorithm34, or the Camin\u2013Sokal maximum parsimony algorithm35 that exhaustively scored all 315 possible tree reconstructions. Both forward simulations and the reconstruction algorithms were implemented in Matlab. For the heat map and the cumulative distribution functions shown in Fig. 3g\u2013i, the fraction of correct relationships was computed as the fraction of all distinct pairwise relationships in the actual tree that were correctly identified in the reconstructed tree. If multiple reconstructions were equally valid (same parsimony score), the fraction of correct relationships was averaged over all of them. Reconstruction accuracy was tested over a wide range of collapse rates (Fig. 3h) or for the approximate collapse rate observed in our experiments, 0.1 per site per generation (Fig. 3g,i). The empirical collapse rate, 0.1, was estimated from the observed co-localization fraction of the barcodes, ~0.67, in 108 MEM-01 colonies induced for approximately 48\u2009h (same colonies as in Fig. 3). In Extended Data Fig. 8a, trees of a higher number of generations were reconstructed from the final collapse pattern using a modified neighbour joining algorithm34 in which allowed reconstructions were restricted to full binary trees. Fraction of correct relationships was again computed as the fraction of all distinct pairwise relationships in the actual tree that were correctly identified in the reconstructed tree averaged over at least 1,000 trees.Event recording simulationsSimulation of signal recording. To demonstrate event recording, we simulated the same forward tree-generation algorithm as in the MEMOIR lineage reconstruction simulations (Fig. 3h and Methods), for trees of six generations, assuming 50 idealized scratchpads and a collapse rate of 0.1 per scratchpad per generation. The simulated cells also contained two additional sets of recording scratchpads of 50 sites each (Fig. 4e). We assumed these scratchpads collapsed through independent events occurring at rates proportional to the magnitude of their respective input signals. The minimum and maximum collapse rates at low and high signal were set to 0 and 0.2 per scratchpad per generation, respectively. The magnitude of the input signals varied over time and from branch to branch as shown in Fig. 4f, g, resulting in different collapse rates for each of the two recording scratchpad sets over time and along different lineages.Reconstruction of simulated signal dynamics. We first reconstructed the lineage tree using only the lineage-tracking scratchpad sites. This reconstruction used a neighbour-joining algorithm, as in Fig. 3h\u200934. We then reconstructed the history of the collapse events of the recording scratchpads on the reconstructed lineage tree. For this procedure, we used a Camin\u2013Sokal maximum parsimony algorithm35. In brief, the algorithm proceeds from the leaves of the tree to the root. At each generation, it infers the collapse state of the parental node, based on the known collapse states of the two daughters, while minimizing the number of new collapse events occurring between the parent and the daughters. For binary scratchpads this corresponds to computing the intersection between the collapse patterns of the two daughters. This procedure is then repeated for the parent and its sister until reaching the root. At the end of this procedure, one obtains a maximum parsimony assignment of scratchpad states to each node in the tree. On the basis of these assignments, we calculated the number of scratchpad collapse events in recording scratchpads that occurred along each branch. Finally, this reconstructed collapse level provides an estimate of the underlying signal intensity along each lineage (for example, actual and reconstructed signals shown for two lineages of interest in Fig. 4g).Data availabilityData that are not included in the paper are available upon reasonable request to the authors.\n\n\nReferencesFrumkin, D., Wasserstrom, A., Kaplan, S., Feige, U. & Shapiro, E.

Bars show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d. of four biological repeats with individual data points marked. c, The relative RNA expression levels of barcode integrations were quantified by RT\u2013qPCR. Bars show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d. of three biological repeats with individual data points marked. d, Scratchpad expression profiles remain constant over 1.3 months of passaging. Low- and high-passage cultures of MEM-01 cells (light and dark bars, respectively) were assayed for RNA expression levels by RT\u2013qPCR. The unchanged expression levels indicate that most barcoded scratchpads express at a consistent level and are not routinely silenced over time. Bars show values from single biological samples with error bars calculated by combining in quadrature the technical replicate variation in barcode and normalizer quantitation cycle, Cq, values. e\u2013g, RNA half-lives assessed by RT\u2013qPCR analysis of transcript levels after blocking transcription with actinomycin D (10\u2009\u03bcg ml\u22121). e, Barcoded scratchpad transcripts were assayed with two different sets of qPCR primers (left and right panels). These data indicate a half-life of approximately 2\u2009h. f, g, Myc and Sdha are known to have short and long mRNA half-lives, respectively, and were assessed as controls, for comparison37,38,39. Myc half-life (f) of 1\u2009h was shorter than the other measured half-lives, while Sdha (g) was longer lived. For Sdha, the measured half-life value (indicated with an asterisk) is expected to overestimate the true value, as Sdha levels were determined relative to those of the similarly long-lived gene Atp5e, whose transcript levels were also decaying over the time course. A previous estimate of Sdha half-life in mESCs was 8\u201313\u2009h (ref. 37). All sample transcript levels were assessed relative to those of Atp5e37,38,39. Transcript abundances were normalized to 1 at time zero. Decay curves were fit assuming one-phase exponential decay using weighted nonlinear least squares regression (e, f) or assuming a linear approximation to exponential decay (g). Half-lives were determined on the basis of the best fit decay constants and a range reported based on the 95% confidence interval (shown in parentheses). Data represent two biological replicates with multiple technical replicates; error bars show standard deviations.Extended Data Figure 2 Barcoded scratchpads collapse to truncated products in activated cells and are stable in full-length and collapsed forms.a, Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified scratchpads reveals scratchpad collapse after gRNA induction. Full-length scratchpads were amplified from plasmid DNA (lane 1), as well as from cells without gRNA constructs (lane 3), or with uninduced gRNAs (lane 4). By contrast, cells expressing gRNA showed shorter products (lane 5). Cells with no scratchpads are also shown as a negative control (lane 2). Bands corresponding to the full-length scratchpad and the collapsed scratchpad are indicated (arrows). Note that the laddering effect seen in all lanes and gels is due in part to PCR amplification artefacts with the repetitive arrays. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1. b, The lowest molecular weight band from scratchpad collapse, as shown in lane 5 in a, was extracted and subcloned into a vector. Nine of the colonies were sequenced. They aligned to a single repeat unit with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking regions, suggesting complete collapse of the repeats owing to Cas9 activity. Six of the nine sequencing reads resulted in collapse to a perfect single repeat (with a possible point mutation in the scratchpad sequence associated with barcode 2), and the remaining three sequencing reads had additional small deletions in the scratchpad. c, Scratchpad collapse requires induction of both Cas9 and gRNA. The gel shows scratchpad states for MEM-01 cells treated with no ligand, with Shield1 (to stabilize Cas9 protein), with Wnt3a (to induce gRNA expression), and with both Wnt3a (100\u2009ng ml\u22121) and Shield1 (100\u2009nM), all after 48\u2009h. d, Scratchpad collapse increased with increasing gRNA activation, as assessed using smFISH to detect scratchpad co-localization with four highly expressed barcodes. Cells were analysed either without gRNA activation or 48\u2009h after gRNA activation by addition of Wnt3a and Shield1 (same concentrations as in c). gRNA expression was measured by the intensity of co-expressed nuclear mTurquoise signal. Box plots show median (red bar), first and third quartiles (box), and extrema of distributions; n\u2009=\u20091,826, 1,081, 345, 191 cells, left to right. Related to Fig. 2c. e\u2013g, Scratchpad states remain stable over extended periods. e, Unactivated MEM-01 cells maintained uncollapsed scratchpads over timescales of months. f, To check the stability of individual barcoded scratchpad variants over time, multiple subclones of MEM-01 were isolated after no activation (control; top panels) and after a pulse of activation for 24\u2009h (Wnt3a 100\u2009ng ml\u22121, Shield1 100\u2009nM; bottom panels). Subclones were assessed for the states of different barcoded scratchpad types after initial isolation (0 month relative age, left) and after one month of maintenance (right). The apparent collapse states (from uncollapsed to fully collapsed) of the barcoded scratchpad types were distinct in different subclones and remained stable over a month, indicating that scratchpad states are stable over these timescales. g, Barcoded scratchpads are also stable over long periods as assessed by smFISH readout. The fraction per cell of barcode transcripts (from four distinct barcode types) that co-localized with scratchpad signal was essentially unchanged between an unactivated low passage cell culture and one maintained for over a month. The imperfect co-localization fraction is largely the result of errors in smFISH detection and not gradual scratchpad collapse. Boxplots as in d; n\u2009=\u20091,826, 983 cells, left to right.Extended Data Figure 3 Scratchpad collapse works with an alternative gRNA, and in multiple cell types.a\u2013d, A Cre-recombinase-activated gRNA is effective at inducing collapse events. a, Schematic of Cre-activated gRNA system. The construct contains a constitutive PGK promoter driving expression of a histone 2B (H2B)\u2013mTurquoise fusion protein (the H2B provides nuclear localization). This is followed by a U6 TATA-lox promoter33 driving expression of an shRNA against mTurquoise, followed in turn by a polyT (T6) transcriptional stop, and then a gRNA directed against scratchpad regions. Prior to Cre expression, expression of the shRNA keeps mTurquoise levels low (brown dashed line) and prevents expression of the gRNA. After the introduction of Cre, the shRNA-stop cassette is removed, allowing mTurquoise and gRNA expression. Thus, mTurquoise provides a visual marker of gRNA expression. This type of gRNA architecture could allow MEMOIR activation in specific tissues expressing Cre. b, PCR analysis shows that Cre can induce scratchpad collapse. Gel shows genomic DNA from a clonal cell line harbouring the construct in a. Scratchpads appear uncollapsed in untransfected cells (left lane), but show significant collapse after transfection with mRNA encoding Cre protein (right lane, approximately 52\u2009h after transfection). Note that the laddering effect seen in all lanes and gels is due in part to PCR amplification artefacts with the repetitive arrays. c, smFISH analysis reveals Cre-activated scratchpad collapse. Quantification of barcode\u2013scratchpad co-localization fractions as measured by smFISH. Cre transfection reduced scratchpad and barcode co-localization levels in cells that showed evidence of Cre activity, as assessed by mTurquoise expression (right). Transfected cells that were mTurquoise-negative or low and untransfected cells retained high co-localization levels (middle and left). Co-localization levels per cell were assessed based on the co-localization of four expressed barcodes with scratchpad transcripts. Box plots show median (red bar), first and third quartiles (box), and extrema of distributions; n\u2009=\u2009995, 643, 649 cells, left to right. d, Example smFISH images of scratchpad and barcode co-localization detected in single cells containing the Cre-activated gRNA. Some activated cells (top panels, mTurquoise expression \u2018on\u2019) show loss of co-localized signal for a specific barcode (top panels, lower cell). Unactivated cells, as assessed by low mTurquoise expression, typically show no loss of co-localization (bottom panels). Scale bars, 10\u2009\u03bcm. e, f, Scratchpads in CHO-K1 cells and yeast also undergo Cas9/gRNA-dependent collapse. e, Cas9- and gRNA-expressing plasmids were transiently transfected into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells containing stably integrated scratchpads. Gel analysis reveals Cas9 and gRNA-dependent scratchpad collapse (middle lane), while transfection with a Cas9-expressing plasmid alone or control plasmids resulted in no collapse (left and right lanes, respectively). f, Scratchpad collapse was tested in a yeast strain with doxycycline-inducible Cas9 and gRNA and integrated scratchpads. Before inducing Cas9-gRNA expression (lane 1 and 3), the scratchpads were intact. After Cas9-gRNA induction with 2\u2009\u03bcg ml\u22121 doxycycline for 11\u2009h, scratchpads appeared collapsed (lane 2 and 4). Left two lanes (lanes 1 and 2) and right two lanes (lanes 3 and 4) correspond to two biological replicates. Note that the scratchpads in CHO-K1 and yeast cells have a similar scratchpad PP7 array to that used elsewhere but different flanking sequences, so their absolute PCR product lengths differ. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.Extended Data Figure 4 Examples of lineage reconstruction for ten colonies.Data for ten colonies that reconstructed with >70% of pairwise relationships correctly identified are shown here. The bubble chart shows the number of barcode transcripts detected (bubble size) and the uncollapsed fraction (colour scale). Matrix of cell-to-cell barcode distance (dissimilarity) scores were computed from the data. Low (blue) values indicate more similar barcoded scratchpad collapse patterns. Note that sisters and cousins tend to have lower distance scores than second cousins, creating a block diagonal pattern in the distance matrix. Lineage trees were reconstructed based on the distance matrix using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (see Methods). Cluster distances from the reconstruction algorithm are shown as branch heights in the reconstructed linkage trees. Percentages on the linkage trees represent frequencies of clade occurrence from a barcode resampling bootstrap. The percentage of correct relationships identified by the depicted lineage reconstruction is shown as a percentage and the actual tree is reported as [(x y)(x y)][(x y)(x y)], where sister pairs are denoted as (x y) and cousins are grouped in brackets ([...]).Extended Data Figure 5 Analysis of reconstruction failure modes.These ten colonies showed reconstruction accuracies similar to those of random data. Bubble charts, distance matrices and linkage trees are shown as in Extended Data Fig. 4. Note the relative lack of block diagonal structures in the distance matrices, which typically reflect evidence of close sister or cousin relationships and less similar second cousins in better reconstructed colonies. Poor reconstructions result from insufficiently informative or inconsistent collapse patterns. These can occur in several ways. First, colonies may have too many collapsed scratchpads (for example, row 2, column 2), leading to degeneracy, and eliminating differences between clades. Second, and more often, colonies have too few collapsed scratchpads (for example, row 3, column 2) to reconstruct the full tree accurately. Third, colonies can provide inconsistent or incomplete lineage information such that the data do not point to one consistent lineage hypothesis (for example, row 5, column 1). Inconsistent information can arise from convergent collapse events in which the same scratchpad randomly collapses in separate branches of the lineage\u2014such noise is inherent to this method of lineage tracking but can be significantly reduced by increasing the number of barcoded scratchpads. Additionally, variability in scratchpad expression, resulting from stochastic expression of individual barcoded scratchpads as well as apparent inconsistencies due to expression of multiple incorporations of the same barcoded scratchpad can generate conflicting information. Despite these issues, colonies can in many cases provide information about some lineage relationships. For example, for the colony in row 5, column 1, all the sister pairs are correctly identified, but they are not definitively placed in the lineage tree owing to conflicting readouts at the cousin level (for example, collapse events in barcodes 9 and 14). Similarly, for the colony in row 5, column 2, cells 3 and 4 are readily identified as sisters because of a common collapse event in barcode 9. But, there is little additional information, such as a collapse event from the two-cell-stage, which would allow the cousins to be correctly identified. These and other sources of noise impacting colony reconstruction are analysed in more detail in Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Information, and can be addressed in future implementations of MEMOIR.Extended Data Figure 6 Bootstrap reconstruction score enriches for colonies that exhibit more accurate lineage reconstruction.a, A bootstrap procedure (Methods) was used to determine the robustness of clade reconstruction to resampling of barcode data for each colony. The frequency of lineage reconstruction at the first cousin clade level was then used to rank all 108 colonies. Colonies with higher reconstruction robustness were enriched for more accurate lineage reconstructions, although no information about accuracy was used to identify these colonies. The top 20% of colonies based on bootstrap score were termed subset 1 (left of blue line; n\u2009=\u200922). This group correctly identified an average of 72% of relationships. The top 40% of colonies were termed subset 2 (left of green line; n\u2009=\u200943) and correctly identified 67% of relationships. Grey region indicates the range of correct relationships expected from random guessing of trees (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d. indicated by line and shading). The bootstrap metric effectively filters out colonies that have insufficient or inconsistent scratchpad collapse information and thus do not robustly generate the same reconstruction. Noise sources that affect the data include convergent scratchpad collapse, imperfect collapse rates that may not result in collapse events every generation, and variable scratchpad expression that limits readout signal or introduces ambiguities due to expression from multiple incorporations of the same barcode type (see Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Information). b, Cumulative distributions show the fraction of pairwise sister, first cousin, and second cousin relationships correctly identified in each colony. Reconstruction accuracies of all these types of lineage relationships are similar to predictions based on the simulated model with eight scratchpads (no noise included). This shows that reconstruction is accurate across all levels of relationships. Related to Fig. 3g.Extended Data Figure 7 Comprehensive error analysis identifies scratchpad expression variability as the key source of noise in MEMOIR experiments.a, Overall reconstruction errors result from three types of noise: the inherent stochastic nature of recording lineage information with stochastic scratchpad collapse events, recording noise (due to fluctuations in the expression levels of Cas9 and gRNA), and readout noise (due to fluctuations in the expression levels of the barcoded scratchpads, variable expression from multiple integrations of the same barcoded scratchpad species (BC), and the fidelity of smFISH imaging readout). b, Cell\u2013cell variability can be decomposed into intra-colony and inter-colony components, as shown schematically. For each hypothetical colony, the relative amounts of each type of variability are plotted (also schematic). c, Plots show experimentally measured intra- and inter-colony noise from gRNA activity (from the fluorescent signal of the Wnt reporter, left), Cas9 expression (from the transcript counts by smFISH, middle), and scratchpad expression (from transcript counts by smFISH, right). These plots represent data from individual cells of all 108 MEM-01 colonies (see Supplementary Information for details). d, Recording noise results in a small decrease in reconstruction accuracy. The plot on the left shows the cumulative distribution of reconstruction accuracies of 500 simulated colonies comprised of trees of three generations, with an average scratchpad collapse rate of 0.1, and 13 scratchpads. The heat map on the right shows the average reconstruction accuracy for 500 simulated colonies for a range of average collapse rates and number of scratchpads. e, Fluctuations in scratchpad (SP) expression levels substantially reduce reconstruction accuracy. Simulation results are plotted as in d, but with the addition of readout noise, rather than recording noise, to the idealized simulations. The readout noise is added as two separate components: scratchpad expression level fluctuations, which significantly increase error, and noise due to smFISH imaging fidelity, which contributes minimally to reconstruction error. The curves are for two integration sites per barcode. f, Cumulative distribution of reconstruction accuracy of 500 simulated colonies with all three components of noise included for different numbers of integration sites per barcode. The thick blue line is the experimental distribution obtained from the 108 MEM-01 colonies. The simulated distribution is consistent with the experimentally observed distribution, especially for two effective integrations per barcode. No fitting parameters were used.Extended Data Figure 8 Performance analysis on deeper trees and trees with missing cells.a, Simulations of reconstruction accuracy of full binary trees for varying numbers of unique barcoded scratchpads, varying collapse rates, and varying numbers of generations (N). The colour of the heat maps corresponds to the fraction of all pairwise lineage relationships correctly identified in the reconstructed tree, averaged over many simulated trees (Fig. 3h in the main text, also see Methods). Even at greater depth (for example, N\u2009=\u200910), trees can be reconstructed accurately with approximately 50 scratchpads. b, The collapse rate that maximizes reconstruction accuracy depends on the number of generations to be tracked, but is only weakly dependent on the number of scratchpads. This is because maximal lineage information is recorded when each scratchpad has a probability of 0.5 of having collapsed by the final time point, regardless of the total number of scratchpads. The plot shows the optimal collapse rate as a function of tree depth, as determined from the simulations (dots) as well as the theoretical expectation of a cumulative collapse probability of 0.5 per scratchpad (dashed line). The theory curve contains no fitting parameters. c, Simulations of reconstruction accuracy for binary trees of three generations as a function of the number of scratchpads and the scratchpad collapse rate for trees with one (left), two (middle), or three (right) randomly chosen endpoint cells missing. Compare with reconstruction accuracy for trees with no missing cells in Fig. 3h. The schematic above each panel shows the topology and branch lengths of trees with the given number of missing cells. A modified neighbour joining algorithm34 was used to exhaustively score all 315 possible reconstructions. To distinguish between reconstructions where tree topology is the same but the branch lengths are different (two such trees are shown bracketed in the schematic of the middle panel), we modified the reconstruction algorithm to estimate the branch lengths connecting a pair of cells based on the hamming distance of their barcoded scratchpad collapse patterns (see Supplementary Information). For example, two cells whose collapse patterns differ substantially would be estimated to have a longer lineage distance between them than would cells with more similar patterns. In general, trees with missing leaves can be reconstructed with accuracy similar to full binary tree (Fig. 3h). As the number of missing cells increases, the reconstruction accuracy decreases because there are fewer cells in the tree to provide lineage information.Extended Data Figure 9 Simulations show that MEMOIR can operate at low collapse rates to reconstruct sparse trees.We simulated MEMOIR in the sparse recording regime, in which collapse events for any given lineage occur, on average, once every few generations. Trees were generated using simulations and reconstructed using a maximum parsimony approach (see Supplementary Information). Experimentally, sparse tree regimes in which collapse events occur infrequently could be achieved with low Cas9 and/or gRNA expression levels or rare expression events (for example, by using weak promoters, occasionally-activated promoters, protein degradation domains), or with decreased Cas9-mediated affinity for target scratchpads (for example, by decreasing the complementarity between the gRNA and target). a, Cartoon of sparse collapse events on a full binary tree. Each collapse changes the state of each scratchpad (arrays of red or black boxes, shown only at nodes where new collapse events occur). At the final generation, there are five populations of cells with distinct collapse patterns, each shown in a different colour. In the sparse representation of the tree (right) each collapse event corresponds to a new branch, and the five leaves correspond to the five subpopulations of cells with distinct collapse patterns. b, Possible source of reconstruction errors. Unrelated clades can converge independently to the same collapse pattern and thus become indistinguishable, resulting in reconstruction errors (tree on the left), but the probability of such coincidences decreases with increasing number of scratchpads (all clades are distinguishable for the tree on the right). c, A simulated sparse tree with 30 leaves and an average depth of 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3. The depth of the tree is defined as the cumulative number of collapse events experienced by each leaf averaged over all the leaves of the tree. The statistics of this tree shape is approximately equivalent to a sparse tree generated by a collapse rate of 0.33 per cell per generation on a full tree of six generations. The heat map shows the status of the scratchpad sites for all the leaves. Each column corresponds to a particular barcoded scratchpad, and each row to a leaf. d, Same as in c, but for a simulated sparse tree with 100 leaves and a depth of 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6; approximately equivalent to a collapse rate of 0.275 per cell per generation on a full tree of eight generations. e, The fraction of correctly identified tree partitions (defined using the Robinson\u2013Foulds metric40) is shown as a function of the number of scratchpads, and normalized by its value in the limit of an infinite number of distinct scratchpads (where a unique collapse pattern is generated for every collapse event). Sparse trees of three different sizes (that is, different numbers of leaves and depth) were generated. Each dot corresponds to one simulated tree. Tree size was held constant as the number of scratchpads was increased, requiring a fixed collapse rate per cell but a collapse rate per scratchpad that scaled inversely with scratchpad number. Trees with fewer leaves and lower depth required fewer scratchpads for accurate reconstruction. But, even larger trees could recover close to the maximal lineage information using only a modest number of scratchpads.Extended Data Figure 10 The Esrrb expression level distribution is stationary.a, Distribution of the number of Esrrb transcripts in individual cells in populations of MEM-01 ES cells activated by the addition of Wnt3a and Shield1 (same conditions as the colonies analysed in Figs. 3 and 4) for different amounts of time (0, 24, and 48\u2009h from top to bottom). The distribution of Esrrb transcript counts does not change significantly over 48\u2009h of Wnt3a exposure as quantified by the P value of the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) test. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was performed for the observed distributions at 24 and 48\u2009h with respect to the reference distribution at 0\u2009h. The cumulative distribution functions (bottom) similarly show that the fraction of cells in the low (or high) Esrrb expression state does not change significantly over 48\u2009h of Wnt3a activation. A stationary Esrrb distribution implies that transitions between the low and high Esrrb expression states must be reversible. b, LIF removal changes the Esrrb distribution. Same as in panel a but with LIF removed from the media at t\u2009=\u20090. The distributions show a significant change during the 48\u2009h period, with the fraction of cells in the low Esrrb expression state increasing over time, as expected41,42.Supplementary informationSupplementary InformationThis file contains Supplementary Methods, describing the distance matrix computation, noise source analysis, sparsely sampled tree simulations, and switching rates inference.

DNA barcoding approaches can provide this information, but do not offer spatial data. This collaboration between the labs of Long Cai and Michael Elowitz harnesses the power of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization (smFISH) to build a new tool, termed MEMOIR, which they use to follow mouse embryonic stem cell divisions. MEMOIR gives access to lineage information in situ and at the single-cell level, while at the same time monitoring changes in gene expression state.show all\n\n\nAssociated Content\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular memoirs of a cellular family\n\n\nLauren E.

Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of ~6500 testicular cells from young adults. We found five niche/somatic cell types (Leydig, myoid, Sertoli, endothelial, macrophage), and observed germline-niche interactions and key human-mouse differences. Spermatogenesis, including meiosis, was reconstructed computationally, revealing sequential coding, non-coding, and repeat-element transcriptional signatures. Interestingly, we identified five discrete transcriptional/developmental spermatogonial states, including a novel early SSC state, termed State 0. Epigenetic features and nascent transcription analyses suggested developmental plasticity within spermatogonial States. To understand the origin of State 0, we profiled testicular cells from infants, and identified distinct similarities between adult State 0 and infant SSCs. Overall, our datasets describe key transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of the normal adult human testis, and provide new insights into germ cell developmental transitions and plasticity.\n\n\n\nIntroductionHuman spermatogenesis involves the differentiation of adult spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) into mature sperm through a complex developmental process, regulated by the testis niche. Human SSCs must carefully balance their self-renewal and differentiation, and then undergo niche-guided transitions between multiple cell states and cellular processes\u2014including a commitment to mitosis, meiosis, and the subsequent stages of sperm maturation, which are accompanied by chromatin repackaging and major morphological changes.1,2 Through a wide range of approaches, considerable progress in understanding gametogenesis and germline-niche communication has been achieved in mice.3,4 In contrast, in humans, although adult testis physiology is well described,5,6,7 much less is known about SSCs and their regulation. Ultimately, a full understanding will require the integration of molecular, genomic, proteomic and physiological approaches.Toward this goal, single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) approaches can effectively delineate cell types, uncover heterogeneity, and infer developmental trajectories.8 These approaches have recently been applied to human fetal germ cells, providing important new biological insights.9 Single-cell approaches are well suited for addressing fundamental questions about SSCs, differentiating spermatogonia and gametogenesis. For example, what are the main molecular features that enable SSCs to serve as the long-term adult germline stem cells? How do SSCs transition from their initial, most na\u00efve and quiescent states to spermatogonia that will eventually commit to meiosis? Are these transitions irreversible, or do spermatogonia possess bidirectional plasticity that helps ensure a lifelong pool of SSCs? Beyond spermatogonia, what are the subsequent sequential transcription and signaling programs that accompany gametogenesis? How are these processes influenced by communication with niche cells\u2014what are the specific signaling and transcription pathways that regulate self-renewal, proliferation rates, metabolism, and transitions between differentiation states? Importantly, these questions overlap conceptually with other stem cell systems. Here, we aim to utilize single-cell transcriptome analysis from the full repertoire of germline and niche cells to address these questions.Prior scRNA-seq efforts characterizing spermatogonia enriched via cell surface markers have provided initial insights into human spermatogenesis.10 However, thanks to new technological advances, it is now possible to use unbiased approaches to assess germline and niche cell transcriptional profiles. Here, we performed extensive scRNA-seq characterization of unselected human testicular cells of young adults using the 10\u00d7 Genomics Chromium platform\u2014yielding a transcriptional cell atlas of all cell types in the testis, including germline and niche cells. We delineate five distinct spermatogonial states in adults, including a novel early SSC state, termed State 0, which displays high similarity to infant SSCs. We further describe the genic and non-coding RNA expression programs that accompany spermatogenesis. Intriguingly, combining RNA \u2018velocity\u2019 analyses11 with chromatin mapping and DNA methylation (DNAme), we provide computational and molecular evidence that human spermatogonia possess considerable transcriptional/state plasticity, suggesting a conceptual framework for human spermatogonial homeostasis, similar to that described in other stem cell systems.ResultsCell partitioning through the analysis of single cell transcriptomesWe isolated single cells from whole-testis of 3 individuals using a standard two-step procedure of enzymatic digestion and physical filtering.7,10 For each donor, two separate technical replicates were performed (Fig.\u00a01a), resulting in six datasets. From a total of ~7000 cells, 6,490 passed standard quality control (QC) dataset filters and were retained for downstream analysis. We obtained ~250\u2009K reads/cell which enabled the analysis of ~2500 genes/cell. The sequencing saturation rate was >83%, and technical replicates were highly similar (r\u2009>\u20090.96; Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S1a).Fig. 1Single cell transcriptome profiling from healthy adult whole testes. a Schematic illustration of the experimental workflow. b tSNE and clustering analysis of combined single-cell transcriptome data from human testes (n\u2009=\u20096490).

Top row represents somatic/niche cell markers; bottom three rows are representative germ cell markers. For each cell type, we show one marker in the main figures and a gallery in supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S2Full size imageCell partitioning via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analyses12 identified 13 clusters (Fig.\u00a01b; Supplementary information, Table S1), with only minor variation based on batch/experiment or donor origin (Fig.\u00a01c; Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S1b and c). Cluster identity was assigned based on known cell-type marker expression (Fig.\u00a01d; Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S2). Clusters 9\u201313 correspond to macrophage, endothelial, myoid, Sertoli and Leydig cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a01d; Supplementary information, Fig. S2a). Germline-specific markers were expressed solely in Clusters 1\u20138 (e.g., DAZL and MAGEA4; Fig.\u00a01d; Supplementary information, Fig. S2b). Moreover, known SSC markers (e.g., UTF1, ID4 and FGFR3), differentiating markers (e.g., KIT and DMRT1), meiosis markers (e.g., SYCP3, SPO11, and MLH3), spermatid structure proteins (e.g., SPAG6, ZPBP, CAMK4 and CREM) and nuclear condensation/protamine repackaging factors (e.g., TNP1 and PRM2) showed sequential expression peaks in Clusters 1 to 8, respectively\u2014mirroring the temporal order of gametogenesis.Human-mouse comparisons in intra-niche and niche-germline interactionWe began by describing the niche cell datasets (Fig.\u00a02). Testicular macrophages (Cluster 9) promote spermatogonia maintenance,13,14 and were identified by multiple specific markers (i.e., CD14, CD163, C1QA; Fig.\u00a01d and 2a). Previous work showed that mouse Sertoli cells help maintain CXCR4+ spermatogonia population by secreting CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4.15 Interestingly, in humans, RNA encoding CXCL12 was observed in Leydig cells, while the CXCR4 receptor was expressed in both macrophages and spermatogonia (Fig.\u00a02a), suggesting that CXCL12-CXCR4 promotes co-localization of macrophages and spermatogonia in humans. Furthermore, CSF1R, the receptor for CSF1, was specifically expressed in macrophages, whereas in mice its expression is confined to spermatogonia.16Fig. 2Expression patterns of representative genes marking niche cells, and Niche-Germline interactions. a Expression patterns (violin plot) of macrophage-specific genes across the 13 different Clusters (Clusters 1\u20138\u2009=\u2009germ cells; Clusters 9\u201313\u2009=\u2009Niche/somatic cells). b Expression patterns (violin plot) of endothelial cell-specific genes across the different clusters. c Expression patterns (violin plot) of myoid cell-specific genes across the different clusters. d Expression patterns (violin plot) of Sertoli cell specific genes across different clusters. e Expression patterns (violin plot) of Leydig cell specific genes across different clusters. f Relative expression levels of representative genes from different key signaling pathways projected onto the tSNE plot from Fig.\u00a01b. Stage-specific expression is highlighted by blue dotted circlesFull size imageIn endothelial cells (Cluster 10, marked by VWF and PECAM1), the receptor (NOTCH4) and the downstream signaling factors (JAG1, HES1 and MAML1) for NOTCH signaling were specifically up-regulated (Fig.\u00a02b). Hedgehog signaling is important for mouse fetal myoid and Leydig cell development;9,17 but the receptors (PTCH1, PTCH2), and downstream signaling components (GLI and IGFBP6) of the Hedgehog pathway were highly expressed in human adult myoid (Cluster 11, marked by MYH11 and ACTA2) and Leydig cells (Fig.\u00a02c), indicating that both Hedgehog and NOTCH signaling activity persists through adulthood in human testes. Sertoli cells (Cluster 12, marked by SOX9 and AMH) express ITGA6, an integrin found in the basal membrane of seminiferous tubules in humans (Fig.\u00a02d). Notably, Sertoli cells express WFDC2, which is known to encode an epididymis protein that may promote sperm maturation,18 and PRND, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein with a putative interaction role with receptors from germ cells.19Leydig cells (Cluster 13, marked by DLK1 and IGF1) also expressed specific genes (Fig.\u00a02e), including those encoding IGF binding proteins (IGFBP5 and IGFBP3) and INHBA, a subunit of both inhibin and activin, and the extracellular matrix protein VIT. Interestingly, key genes for testosterone biosynthesis, STAR and HSD17B3, were expressed in both Sertoli and Leydig cells, while the expression of the responsive genes, SHBG and SRD5A2, were observed in maturing sperm (Fig.\u00a02f). Retinoic acid (RA) induces germ cell differentiation, and enzymes for RA synthesis, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3, were specifically expressed in Leydig and myoid cells; while STRA8, an RA target gene, was only observed during the transition of spermatogonia to spermatocytes (Fig.\u00a02f). Interestingly, we found the WNT ligand, WNT2B, was expressed primarily in myoid cells, while WNT2B receptors were confined to primary spermatocytes, suggesting a role for WNT2B in human meiosis (Fig.\u00a02f). PDGFB was expressed in endothelial cells, and its receptors PDGFRA and PDGFRB were found in Leydig and myoid cells, indicating that endothelial cells may indirectly affect germ cell development, via cross-talk mechanisms with other niche cells. Taken together, our data highlight both similarities and notable differences in germline-niche interactions in humans and mice that warrant further detailed functional investigations.Pseudotime and clustering analyses reveal dynamic gene expression patterns during spermatogenesisNoticeably, the germ cell clusters (1\u20138) formed a wave-like continuum, sometimes separated by distinct bottlenecks, that recapitulated the temporal order of spermatogenesis. Pseudotime analysis20 provided an arrow vector which aligned with the developmental order of gametogenesis (Fig.\u00a03a). Clustering analysis of genes (rows) while fixing the order of cells (columns) along pseudotime, revealed 12 distinct gene cohorts. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these clusters yielded a dynamic developmental, cellular and metabolic sequence of events, consistent with well-organized germline development (Fig.\u00a03b; Supplementary information, Table\u00a0S2). Next, differential analysis (bimodal test; adjusted p-value\u2009<\u20090.01; |logFC|\u2009>\u20090.25) identified differentially-expressed genes (Fig.\u00a03c; Supplementary information, Table\u00a0S3). As expected, \u2018cell cycle\u2019, \u2018meiosis\u2019 and \u2018spermatogenesis\u2019 were significantly-enriched GO terms during spermatogenic progression. Interestingly, >4600 genes were differentially expressed (2525 up and 2101 down) during the transition from spermatocytes to round spermatids, displaying the most dramatic transcriptomic change.Fig. 3Gene expression dynamics during spermatogenesis. a Pseudotime analysis on germ cells (Clusters 1\u20138). Cluster 1 represents the start of pseudotime, with Cluster 8 at the end. b K-means clustering of genes exhibiting differential expression (n\u2009=\u20098485) across germ cell populations. Note: each row represents a gene, and each column represents a single cell, with columns/cells placed in pseudotime order as defined in Fig. 3a and depicted by a thick colored line (top, color code as in Fig. 3a). Differential gene expression levels utilize a Z score, which represents the variance from the mean, as defined on the color key in the right top corner. c Differentially-expressed genes and associated GO terms (using DAVID v6.7) characteristic of germ cell developmental transitions, based on the 8 germ cell Clusters represented in Fig.\u00a02a.

GO: gene ontologyFull size imageGermline expression dynamics of transposable elements, lncRNAs and XIST\nSingle-cell datasets allow a refined examination of transposable elements (TE) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Supplementary information, Figs.\u00a0S3a\u2013c and S4a\u2013b). Pseudotime and clustering analyses identified dynamic TE and lncRNA programs during spermatogenesis. Notably, LTR12C/D/E and the active TEs SVA_D and AluYa5 showed high expression during early spermatogenic stages. By contrast, LTR10A and LTR40c expression peaks during late spermatogonial or post-meiotic stages; and satellite and multiple MLT-family TEs at spermatid and sperm stages (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S3d). Moreover, we explored X chromosome inactivation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis.21,22 Notably, we observed XIST expression during spermatogonial stages (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S4c and d), and unexpectedly selective attenuation of genes that are near the X-inactivation center during spermatogonial stages (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S4e and f), suggesting a role for XIST-mediated silencing in this process. Overall, our datasets and analyses provide a comprehensive resource to study TEs and lncRNA expression dynamics during male germline development.Analysis of meiotic cells reveals dynamic transcriptional programs and key factors during meiotic transitionNext, we singled out Clusters 3\u20134 (Fig.\u00a01b) and performed re-clustering of the meiotic cells, which revealed five sub-clusters (Fig.\u00a04a). Using known markers23,24 (Fig.\u00a04b), we assigned pre-leptotene, leptotene, zygotene/early pachytene, late pachytene, and diplotene cell types, consistent with the pseudotime developmental order. Secondary spermatocytes were under-represented consistent with their rapid progression into round spermatids.25 Gene clustering analysis (Fig.\u00a04c) identified five distinct molecular signatures (4594 genes) suggesting striking transcriptional changes during meiotic entry and exit, but only gradual changes during meiosis. Notably, several RNA binding proteins were upregulated at zygotene/early pachytene, and some HOX genes (e.g., HOXB4 and HOXC6) showed late pachytene-specific expression (Fig.\u00a04c, d).Fig. 4Gene Expression Dynamics during Meiosis. a Focused analysis (tSNE, clustering and pseudotime ordering) of the cells from Clusters 3 and 4 (from Figs.\u00a01b and 3a) reveals developmental progression during meiosis I. b Expression patterns of known meiotic markers projected onto the tSNE plot.

Although the function of DMRTC2 and DMRT3 is largely unknown, Sox30 knockout causes murine germ cell development arrest at round spermatid stage, and reduces expression of Sox5.28,29 Overall, our data are consistent with findings in mice, but also provide evidence for candidate genes with human-specific functions during meiosis.Identification of known and novel spermatogonial stem cell statesTo further characterize the spermatogonial \u2018States\u2019, we re-clustered the early germ cells Clusters 1\u20132 (Fig.\u00a05a). This analysis yielded five distinct clusters: while four showed high similarity to the clusters/states previously described (States 1\u20134 in ref.10) an additional state, hereafter termed \u2018State 0\u2019 was identified (Supplementary information, Table S4). None of the clusters/states (including State 0) consisted of cells derived from a particular donor or within a specific cell cycle phase (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S5a\u2013d). Pseudotime analysis revealed a wave-like progression from State 0 to State 4, and clustering analyses defined gene expression signatures associated with each State (Fig.\u00a05b; Supplementary information, Table S5). Notably, we observed a striking shift in transcriptional programs between State 1 and State 2, dominated by expression of cell cycle/proliferation genes (e.g., MKI67), suggesting that this transition represents a critical developmental node (see Discussion).Fig. 5Identification of five discrete transcriptional states for SSCs. a Focused analysis (tSNE, clustering and pseudotime ordering) of Clusters 1 and 2 (from Fig.\u00a01b and 3a) reveals five discrete cellular states (States 0 to 4) during SSC development. b K-means clustering (k\u2009=\u20096) of genes exhibiting differential gene expression in States 0\u20134. Six gene clusters (termed S1-S6) were identified. Gene ontology associated with each gene block is shown on the right. Note: each row represents a gene, and each column represents a single cell, with columns/cells placed in pseudotime order (depicted by different colors on the top of the figure) as defined in a. Gene expression levels utilize a Z score, which depicts variance from the mean, as defined on the color key in the right top corner. c Relative expression levels of selected SSC markers projected on the tSNE plot represented in a. d Violin plots representing the expression levels of the selected markers shown in c in States 0\u20134 (x-axis). e Relative expression levels of selective State 0-specific markers projected on the tSNE plot represented in a. f Violin plots representing the expression levels of selective State 0-specific markers shown in e in States 0\u20134 (x-axis)Full size imageWhile both State 0 and State 1 cells co-express many key stem cell signaling factors and TFs (Fig.\u00a05c, d), our analyses identify 490 genes that are either most highly expressed, or specifically expressed, in State 0 (e.g., PIWIL4, EGR4, TSPAN33, PHGDH, PPP1R36, ICA1L (Fig.\u00a05e, f)). Known early SSC markers (ID4, FGFR3, TCF3 and UTF1) were expressed in States 0 and 1, whereas known markers of differentiation (KIT) or proliferation (MKI67) were specifically expressed during or after State 2, suggesting State 0 and State 1 may represent two distinct quiescent SSC states. Interestingly, most State 0 cells displayed low expression of ST3GAL2, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of SSEA4 (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S5g), suggesting that State 0 cells do not express this spermatogonial cell surface marker.RNA velocity analysis and chromatin profiling suggest SSC plasticityNext, we applied RNA \u2018velocity\u2019 analysis, a computational approach that utilizes nascent transcription in scRNA-seq datasets to infer developmental trajectories.11 Here, the ratio of unspliced to spliced reads for each transcript is used as a proxy measurement of new transcription. By comparison with steady state (spliced) transcripts in the other cells, a velocity vector representing the future transcriptional state of each individual cell can be defined. Within each cell of the tSNE plot (Fig.\u00a06a), the amplitude and direction of the vector reflects a transcriptional trajectory. This analysis revealed two unexpected features. First, within the State 0 cluster, we observed two sub-populations: one proximal to State 1, bearing long vectors, indicating an apparent progression towards State 1\u2014and a second sub-population lacking long vectors. This pattern suggests that the former cell sub-population is actively progressing/committing towards State 1, in response to specific developmental cues/signals, while the latter is not. Second, we also observed a sub-group of State 2 cells displaying long velocity vectors pointing back toward State 1. This forward and backward movement between States 0\u20131\u20132 raises the possibility that human spermatogonia display dynamic plasticity and metastable/uncommitted behaviors.Fig. 6Computational and molecular examination of spermatogonial plasticity. a Visualization of the RNA velocity analysis results on the tSNE plot of SSCs (see main text for details on vectors). b Heatmap and hierarchical clustering of ATAC-seq data from KIT+ spermatogonia (two replicates), SSEA4+ SSCs (four replicates) and ESCs (two replicates). Note: SSEA4+ SSC and ESC data are from ref.10 c Schematic summarizing the combinatorial gene expression programs and cellular events promoting five distinct SSC states (States 0\u20134) and depiction of the proposed spermatogonial dynamics/kinetics and behavioral plasticity of States with main cellular events and molecular pathways. Dotted arrows are speculativeFull size imageWe then explored whether methylation or chromatin status may provide further evidence of plasticity. First, although\u2009>\u20098,000 genes show differential expression during spermatogonial development and spermiogenesis (Fig.\u00a03b), we observed almost no differences in the DNAme profiles of SSEA4-enriched human SSCs and that of mature human sperm\u2014which parallels a similar finding in mice.10,30 Thus, no DNAme barrier exists that might deter spermatogonial de-differentiation. Next, we profiled open chromatin from differentiating/committed spermatogonia (enriched using c-KIT), and compared it to profiles of self-renewing SSCs (enriched with SSEA4) (Fig.\u00a06b). Notably, the open chromatin maps of c-KIT or SSEA4-enriched spermatogonia were highly similar (r\u2009>\u20090.83), and their nearest peak summits were typically overlapping (within a distance of ~120\u2009bp), indicating that very few changes in the open chromatin landscape occurred during the commitment of undifferentiated SSEA4+ SSCs into differentiating c-KIT+ spermatogonia, in spite of the activation and repression of hundreds of genes. Taken together, the scRNA-seq analysis, the RNA velocity trends and evidence derived from the analysis of open chromatin landscape and DNAme are consistent with the proposal that SSCs follow a developmental progression involving 5 sequential transcriptional states characterized by a \u2018flat\u2019 chromatin/DNAme landscape, strongly suggestive of dynamic behaviors of spermatogonial cells (Fig.\u00a06c).The adult State 0 is most similar to infant germ cellsTo assess whether State 0 may represent the earliest/na\u00efve SSC in adults, we profiled testicular cells from infants (12\u201313 months old). After QC filtering, we obtained ~1300 single cells and assigned cell identities based on known markers. This analysis identified four somatic cell types, i.e., Sertoli, Leydig, endothelial and macrophage (Fig.\u00a07a, b; Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S7), and one tight cluster of 37 germ cells. Comparison to adult SSC States via tSNE and pseudotime analysis, positioned the infant germ cells adjacent to adult State 0, at the \u2018beginning\u2019 of the developmental trajectory (Fig.\u00a07c). Moreover, most State 0 markers were highly expressed in infant germ cells (Fig.\u00a07d). A small set of factors (e.g., TBX3, HOXA3) showed specific expression in infant spermatogonia,31 which may specify their germline identity. In addition, transcriptomic data of infant somatic cells should provide a useful resource for future analysis.Fig. 7Single cell RNA profiling from infant testis and comparison to adult scRNA-seq data. a tSNE and clustering analysis of single-cell transcriptome from infant testis (n\u2009=\u20091340). b Expression patterns of representative markers to help assign cell identities. c tSNE and pseudotime analysis of infant germ cells and adult spermatogonia. d Expression patterns (violin plot) of representative genes in infant germ cells and adult spermatogoniaFull size imageValidation of SSC States via sequential mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridizationFor validation, we performed sequential single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH)32 on 5 key genes (Fig.\u00a08a; Supplementary information, Table\u00a0S6). In cells expressing moderate/high TCF3 (State 0 and State 1), only 27% (9/33) displayed high expression of PIWIL4 (State 0 marker) and ETV5/L1TD1 (State 1), while the remainder expressed either PIWIL4 (27%) or ETV5/L1TD1 (39%). This yielded significant non-overlap between State 0 and State 1 markers (hypergeometric test; p\u2009=\u20090.03), consistent with scRNA-seq data.Fig. 8RNA and protein staining to validate state 0. a Sequential RNA FISH of SSC markers on tubular sections.

Each antigen (named in green on the left side) is represented by 5 panels. Scale bar: 10\u2009\u03bcmFull size imageThe State 0 marker TSPAN33 shows co-localization with high FGFR3We next sought to enrich State 0 cells using cell surface markers, and assess their SSEA4 status. Here, we used TSPAN-family receptors, which show a strong enrichment in State 0 (e.g., TSPAN33; Fig.\u00a05f). Flow cytometry analysis of cells expressing high levels of the SSC marker FGFR3 (peaks in State 0, present in State 1; Fig.\u00a05d), show that FGFR3high cells have high TSPAN33 but low SSEA4 (Fig.\u00a08b)\u2014characterizing State 0 as FGFR3high TSPAN33high SSEA4low.In situ observation of early SSC States via protein immunofluorescenceWe characterized the protein expression of early spermatogonial markers (UTF1, GFRA1, FGFR3, and TCF3)33 that exhibit differential expression across early States (0\u20131\u20132) by performing triple immunofluorescence (IF) staining. UTF1 expression peaked at State 0, and only partially overlaped with GFRA1, which peaks in State 1 (Fig.\u00a05d). We observed that ~66% of cells located at the periphery of the seminiferous tubules expressed either UTF1 and/or GFRA1, as previously reported.34 Here, we distinguished two broad spermatogonial phenotypes, characterized by either UTF1high/GFRA1low or GFRA1high/UTF1low, that recapitulate the temporal progression from State 0 to State 1. Furthermore, the spermatogonial markers FGFR3 and TCF3 were expressed in a subset of cells expressing either UTF1 and/or GFRA1, but were never observed on their own (Fig.\u00a08c). One simple explanation is that RNAs strongly expressed in State 0 (e.g., UTF1) produce a protein with a longer half-life than its RNA, and therefore the protein persists into the State 1 GFRA1-expressing cells\u2014providing heterogeneity. As expected, the proliferating marker MKI67 showed almost no overlap with GFRA1 or UTF1 (Fig.\u00a08c and data not shown), suggesting that transition to the proliferative State 2 occurs with the loss of SSC markers, which is consistent with our computational analyses (Figs.\u00a05 and 6c).Finally, we further characterized the expression of genes specific to State 0 or State 1. Using the Human Protein Atlas resource (http://www.proteinatlas.org/) to review the pattern of 490 State 0 genes,35 16 candidate early SSC markers which displayed specific expression in cells located along the periphery of the seminiferous tubule were chosen. Triple IF staining with UTF1 and GFRA1 showed that each of these 16 markers is expressed in GFRA1-positive and/or UTF1-positive cells. Antibodies to PHGDH and PPP1R36 display strong staining in UTF1high (State 0) cells, as predicted by the scRNA-seq analysis (Fig.\u00a08d). Other State 0 markers showed expression in early spermatogonia (Fig.\u00a08d; Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S8b), an expected result for instances where the protein half-life is greater than that of the transcripts. In several instances, including PIWIL4 and MAGEB1, we observed differences in staining intensity and/or sub-nuclear localization in cells co-expressing either UTF1high or GFRA1high marker (Fig.\u00a08d; Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S8b). These observations are consistent with the proposal that although State 0 and State 1 define transcriptionally discrete states, they likely represent metastable/heterogeneous cellular phenotypes that afford SSCs the ability to adapt to a dynamic niche environment and ensure homeostatic regulation within the testis.DiscussionHuman adult spermatogenesis is a complex process, and a full understanding will involve the integration of multiple data types\u2014including those from rodents, where genetic tools and SSC culturing systems are already available\u2014to determine both shared and unique mechanism in mice and men. Here, we aimed to provide foundational scRNA-seq data of all cells contained within the normal human young adult testis, complemented by computational analysis and validation studies\u2014to offer new insights into the regulation of male gametogenesis in humans.Signaling features in the human testis nicheA major area of current interest involves communication between the niche and germline, and how these interactions mediate the changes observed during puberty and ageing. Here, we report new data that reveal potential differences between mice and men, and changes during development, for future functional investigation. First, for CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling (for SSC homing to the niche), CXCL12 was primarily expressed at the RNA level by Leydig cells in humans rather than by Sertoli cells in mice. Furthermore, mouse SSCs express Csf1r for Csf1 response, while human CSF1R expression appears to be specific to macrophages. Moreover, we identified novel markers for niche cells, like WFDC2 and PRND for Sertoli cells, and VIT for Leydig cells. Beyond these examples, our datasets provide a resource for additional analyses of niche cells and niche-germline communication. Furthermore, our transcriptome data on infant testes concur that major differences exist between infant somatic cells and their counterparts in the adult (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S7), and exploration of the mechanisms mediating these changes prior to and during puberty will be an important future research focus.Computational analysis of spermatogonial development and spermatogenesisHere, we demonstrate that the dynamic and temporal trajectory of germline development could be reconstructed using scRNA-seq data and dedicated computational/analytical tools. The distribution of cell types for all three donors largely overlap during SSC stages and the early and mid stages of gametogenesis, establishing overall consistency between donors. However, modest differences were observed in late stages. Here, we note that the RNA content of maturing/mature sperm is both low and of poor integrity, a known and conserved property in mammals, conferring low number of genes/UMIs (unique molecular identifiers) in the maturing sperm datasets (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S1d). Therefore, although two distinct clusters of sperm were computationally obtained (Clusters 7 and 8), an alternative interpretation is that these sperm populations are similar, and simply contain different levels of RNA degradation/removal during this unique, transcriptionally inactive stage.We also provide several new insights into spermatogonial development, most importantly the identification of a novel and early quiescent state, termed State 0. This interpretation is based on the properties/categories of the 490 differentially-regulated genes and the high similarities to the transcriptomic profile of infant germ cells. Moreover, State 0 cells (in contrast to State 1 cells) show low expression of the cell surface marker SSEA4, likely explaining why they escaped characterization in our prior study, which relied on SSEA4-mediated enrichment of testicular cells. Thus, we suggest that State 0 cells represent the undifferentiated and quiescent \u2018reserve\u2019 stem cell pool in the adult germline that is largely maintained from infants to adults.Our data also call for a re-examination of prior work on human spermatogonial development. GFRA1 marks early undifferentiated spermatogonia,36 but exhibits a heterogeneous expression in human34 and mouse37 SSCs. Recently, using immunostaining, DiPersio et al.,34 proposed that \u2018early\u2019 (slow proliferating) GFRA1high UTF1\u2212 SSCs progress to GFRA1low UTF1+, before committing to differentiation (c-KIT+). However, our scRNA-seq data and pseudotime analysis suggest an alternative sequence of events\u2014where UTF1 precedes the expression of GFRA1\u2014which, interestingly aligns with recent work in the mouse.37 Beyond these two markers, we additionally provided data on hundreds of candidate spermatogonial markers (and validated 16 new protein markers) that define State 0 and State 1 SSCs in humans.Computational and molecular evidence for plasticity within early spermatogoniaPlasticity and stochastic behaviors within spermatogonial stem cell populations have been reported in several species including Drosophila and mice, in which differentiating spermatogonia can dedifferentiate and regain their early self-renewing properties.38,39,40,41 Our work provides two lines of evidence consistent with developmental plasticity in early human spermatogonia. First, RNA velocity analysis singled out a population of State 2 spermatogonia tending to \u2018dedifferentiate\u2019 into State 1-like cells. Notably, the transition from State 1 to State 2 is marked by an upregulation of proliferative markers\u2014and thus might be a critical node for homeostasis by which developmental plasticity allows to balance early versus differentiating SSC populations.42 Second, we observe very limited changes in open chromatin and DNAme along the developmental trajectory of spermatogonia, which may enable transcriptional plasticity to take place by lowering epigenetic barriers to transcriptional changes, and dedifferentiation. Overall, we propose a spermatogonial developmental trajectory that involves 5 sequential transcriptional States, which generate moderately heterogeneous (metastable) proteomes, to enable State transitions and maintain a constant SSC pool; properties which might be essential to maintain life-long fertility, and critical for the germline replenishment in case of damage.A resource for future investigation of spermatogenesisRecently, scRNA-seq has emerged as a highly useful approach for the study of human and mouse spermatogenesis.29,43,44 Here, our data reveals\u2009>\u20098000 genes that undergo significant differential regulation during male gametogenesis, and our results align well with a very recent scRNA-seq study of gametogenesis.44 Beyond coding genes, our work has uniquely explored transposable elements (TE) and long non-coding RNAs\u2014which are shown to display remarkable stage-specific expression. Of particular interest are the expression of active LTR12C/D/E, SVA_D and AluYa5 elements during early spermatogenesis, LTR10A and LTR40c elements during spermatogonial stages. We also described XIST expression during spermatogonial stages\u2014which we show coincides with the selective attenuation of genes near the XIC (Supplementary information, Fig.\u00a0S4), suggesting an unexpected role for XIST spreading and silencing in this process. Taken together, our datasets and analyses provide a comprehensive resource for the study of both niche cells and germline cells\u2014including coding genes, TEs and lncRNA expression dynamics\u2014which will also serve as a useful reference dataset for comparisons to younger and older men, infertile men, and testicular cancer.Materials and methodsExperimental model and subject detailsAdult human testicular samples for scRNA-seq and immunostaining were from three healthy men (donor #1: 17 years old; donor #2: 24 years old; donor #3: 25 years old); sample for mRNA seqFISH was from a healthy man (donor #4: 23 years old). Infant testicular samples for scRNA-seq were from two infant donors (13 months old). All six samples were obtained through the University of Utah Andrology laboratory and Intermountain Donor Service. Those samples were removed from deceased individuals who consented to organ donation for transplantation and research. Sample used for ATAC-seq was obtained through the University of Utah Andrology laboratory consented for research (IRB approved protocol #00075836: understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics in human spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation).Sample storage by cryopreservationOnce collected, the pair of whole testis samples was transported to the research laboratory on ice in saline or Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; GIBCO cat # 24020117) and processed within 1\u2009h of removal by surgery. Around 90% of each testis was divided into smaller portions (~0.5\u20131\u2009g for each) using scissors and directly transferred into cryovials (Corning cat # 403659) in DMEM medium (Life Technologies cat # 11995073) containing 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich cat # D8779), 15% fetal bovine serum/FBS (Gibco cat # 10082147) and cryopreserved in a Mr. Frosty Freezing container (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat #\u00a05100\u20130001) ensuring a slow controlled freezing rate at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C for overnight. Cryovials were then transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.Sample fixation for immunostainingsAround 10% of the remaining testis tissues were incubated in 40\u2009mL of 1\u00d7 PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde/PFA (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat # 28908) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with agitation on a rotor (60\u2009rpm). Fixed samples were then washed three times in cold PBS and stored in PBS at 4\u2009\u00b0C until processing for immunostaining.Human adult testis sample preparation for single cell RNA sequencingFor each single cell sequencing experiment (technical replicate for one donor), ~5 cryovials were thawed in ~3\u2009min. Tissues were washed twice in 1\u00d7 PBS, and subjected to a standard two-step digestion procedure, as described previously.10 Briefly, testicular tissues were digested with collagenase type IV (Sigma Aldrich cat # C5138\u2013500MG) for 5\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C with gentle agitation (250\u2009rpm), then shaken vigorously and incubated for another 3\u2009min. The tubules were sedimented by centrifugation at 200\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min and washed with HBSS before digestion with 4.5\u2009mL 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Invitrogen cat # 25300054) and 4 kU DNase I (Sigma Aldrich cat # D4527\u2013500ku). The suspension was triturated vigorously three to five times and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. The process was repeated in 5\u2009min increments for up to 15\u2009min total. The digestion was stopped by adding 10% FBS (Gibco cat # 10082147). Single testicular cells were obtained by filtering through strainers with mesh size 70\u2009\u00b5m (Fisher Scientific cat # 08\u2013771\u20132) and 40\u2009\u00b5m (Fisher Scientific cat # 08\u2013771\u20131). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600\u00d7\u2009g for 15\u2009min, and washed twice with 1\u00d7 PBS. Cell number was measured using hemocytometer, and cells were then re-suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS +\u00a00.4% BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat # AM2616) at the concentration of ~1000\u2009cells/uL, ready for single cell sequencing.Human infant testis sample preparation for single cell RNA sequencingWe performed two technical replicates for the infant donor. A quarter of the testis was thawed in ~5\u2009min. Tissues were washed twice in 1\u00d7 PBS, and minced into small pieces for better digestion outcome. Tissues were then treated with trypsin EDTA for ~25\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The digestion was then stopped by adding 10% FBS (Gibco cat # 10082147). Single testicular cells were obtained by filtering through strainers with mesh size 70\u2009\u00b5m (Fisher Scientific cat # 08\u2013771\u20132) and 40\u2009\u00b5m (Fisher Scientific cat # 08\u2013771\u20131). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600\u00d7\u2009g for 15\u2009min, and washed twice with 1\u00d7 PBS. Cell number was measured using hemocytometer, and cells were then re-suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS\u2009+\u20090.4% BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat # AM2616) at the concentration of ~1000\u2009cells/uL, ready for single cell sequencing.Single cell RNA-seq performance, library preparation and sequencingscRNA-Seq was performed using the 10\u00d7 Genomics system. Briefly, each experiment captured ~1500 single cells, in order to obtain ~0.8% multiplex rate. Cells were diluted following manufacturer recommendations, and mixed with 33.8\u2009\u00b5L of total mixed buffer before being loaded into 10\u00d7 Chromium Controller using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2019 v2 reagents. Each sequencing library was prepared following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with 13 cycles used for cDNA amplification. Then ~100\u2009ng of cDNA were used for library amplification by 12 cycles. The resulting libraries were then sequenced on a 26\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 cycle paired-end run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.Process of single cell RNA-seq dataRaw sequencing data were demultiplexed using the mkfastq application (Cell Ranger v1.2.1). Three types of fastq files were generated: I1 contains 8\u2009bp sample index; R1 contains 26\u2009bp (10\u2009bp cell-BC\u2009+\u200916\u2009bp UMI) index and R2 contains 100\u2009bp cDNA sequence. Fastq files were then run with the cellranger count application (Cell Ranger v1.2.1) using default settings, to perform alignment (using STAR v2.5.4a), filtering and cellular barcode and UMI counting. The UMI count tables of each cellular barcode were used for further analysis.Sequential RNA florescence in situ hybridizationNon-barcoded seqFISH (sequential FISH) probes were designed by targeting consensus of all constitutive exons (Supplementary information, Table S6) present in the masked hg38 human genome with 35-nucleotide (nt). All probes were blasted against the human transcriptome, and expected copy numbers of off-target probe hits were calculated using predicted RNA counts from RNA-seq dataset.10 Probes were then attached with one of the DNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) initiator sequences (B1, B2, B3, B4 or B5) at 5\u2019 end with 4-nt \u2018ATAT\u2019 space in between. Initiator sequences were specific to genes in each round of hybridizations.Non-barcoded seqFISH was performed by following the previous protocol.32 Human testis tissues were first perfused with RNase-free PBS, and embedded in 30% RNase free sucrose (VWR cat # 97061\u2013430). After the tissues sank, they were frozen using a dry ice/isopropanol bath in OCT media and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. 15-\u00b5m sections were cut using cryotome and immediately placed on an aminosilane modified coverslip. The generated human testis sections mounted to coverslips (Thermo Scientific cat # 152450) were permeabilized at 4\u2009\u00b0C in 70% EtOH for 12\u201318\u2009h. Tissue sections were further permeabilized by adding RNase-free 8% SDS (10% SDS Ambion cat # AM9822) for 20\u2009min. Samples were rinsed with 70% EtOH to remove SDS, and air-dried. The hybridization chambers (Grace Bio-Labs cat # 621505) were adhered around the tissue sections. Then samples were washed once with 2\u00d7\u2009SSC (Invitrogen cat # 15557\u2013036) diluted in Ultrapure water (Invitrogen cat # 10977\u2013015), and hybridized with 2.5\u2009nM probes per incubation for overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in Hybridization Buffer (50% HB: 2\u00d7\u2009SSC, 50% Formamide (v/v) (Ambion cat # AM9344), 10% Dextran Sulfate (w/v) (Sigma cat # D8906), in Ultrapure water). Samples were washed in 50% Wash Buffer (50% WB: 2\u00d7\u2009SSC, 50% Formamide (v/v), 0.1% Triton-X 100 (Sigma X-100) in Ultrapure water) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. While washing, aliquoted HCR hairpins (Molecular Instruments Inc.) were heated to 95\u2009\u00b0C for 1.5\u2009min and allowed to cool to room temperature for 30\u2009min in the dark. The HCR hairpins were diluted to a concentration of 120\u2009nM per hairpin in amplification buffer (2\u00d7\u2009SSC, 10% Dextran Sulfate (w/v)), and incubated with the samples for 45\u2009min at room temperature in the dark. Following amplification, samples were washed in the 30% Wash Buffer (30% WB: 2\u00d7\u2009SSC, 30% Formamide (v/v), 0.1% Triton-X 100 in Ultrapure water) for 30\u2009min to remove non-specifically bound hairpins. Samples were then stained with 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL DAPI (Sigma cat # D8417) in 2\u00d7\u2009SSC and imaged as described below. After imaging, samples were digested with DNase I (10 units of DNase I, 1\u00d7\u2009buffer (Roche cat # 04716728001) in Ultrapure water) for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C on the microscope using custom made heat pad. Following DNase I treatment, the samples were washed with 30% WBT at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, and hybridized with the following round of probe set for overnight with 2.5\u2009nM probes per each in 50% HB at 37\u2009\u00b0C on the microscope. Samples were then washed, amplified with HCR hairpins and imaged as before. The above steps were iterated at each hybridization round.Following the last non-barcoded seqFISH, immunofluorescence was performed. The samples were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS (Ambion cat # AM9624) for a few times, blocked with 5% BSA blocking solution (5% BSA (Gemini cat # 700\u2013106\u2009P), 1\u00d7 PBS, and 0.3% Triton-X 100 in Ultrapure water), and then incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009h. The primary antibody, Anti-beta Catenin (Abcam cat # ab6301), was 100-fold diluted in 1% BSA solution (1% BSA, 1\u00d7 PBS, 0.3% Triton-X), incubated with the samples at room temperature for 3\u2009h. The samples were then washed with 1\u00d7 PBS for three times for 15\u2009min each. The secondary antibody (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 Invitrogen cat # A31571) was 500-fold diluted in 1% BSA buffer, and incubated with the samples at room temperature for 1\u2009h. Samples were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS for three times, stained with DAPI and imaged as described below.Samples were imaged in an anti-bleaching buffer (14\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH\u2009=\u20098.0, 35\u2009mM NaCl, 0.8% D-Glucose (Sigma cat # G7528), 100-fold diluted Catalase (Sigma cat # C3155), Pyranose oxidase with OD405 of 0.05 (Sigma cat # P4234), and saturated amount of Trolox (Sigma cat # 238813)) with the microscope (Leica, DMi8) equipped with a confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa CSU-W1), a sCMOS camera (Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus), 63\u00d7\u2009oil objective lens (Leica 1.40 NA), and a motorized stage (ASI MS2000). Lasers from CNI and filter sets from Semrock were used. Snapshots were acquired with 0.5\u2009\u03bcm z steps across 15\u2009\u03bcm with more than 10 positions per sample.seqFISH signals were visualized using ImageJ software. Firstly, all images were aligned manually in xy and z by using DAPI channel signals. Each channel of HCR signals was background subtracted using ImageJ\u2019s subtract background function with rolling ball radius of 3 pixels. Images were applied by ImageJ\u2019s mean integral image filter with block radius of 3 pixels, and then contrasted. Each image was visualized with an overlay of DAPI signals of the first round of hybridization.Immunostainings of testis tissuesThe triple immunofluorescence stainings were performed on 5\u2009\u00b5m formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from portions of the testis from Donor 2 and 3 (24 and 25 years old respectively) following deparaffinisation, rehydratation and heat-mediated antigen retrieval in 10\u2009mM sodium citrate buffer solution (pH 6). After treatment with Superblock (PBS) Blocking Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 37515) for 30\u2009min, individual sections were incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with a mix of three diluted antibodies (UTF1 (mouse monoclonal), GFRA1 (goat polyclonal) and a third rabbit polyclonal antibody (for antibodies details and dilutions, see the Table below). Antigen detection was conducted using the appropriate combination of Alexa Fluor 488, 555 and 647 secondary antibodies (all 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # A21202, cat # A21432, cat # A31573 respectively) for 2\u2009h at room temperature in the dark. All primary/secondary antibodies were diluted in SignalBoost\u2122 Immunoreaction Enhancer Kit (Calbiochem, cat # 407207\u20131KIT). After three washes in PBS, sections were incubated with DAPI (4\u2019,6-Diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) (Roche, cat # 10 236 276 001) to facilitate nuclear visualization (dilution: 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL). Specificity of the antibody staining was confirmed using the same protocol but with omission of primary antibodies. Following multiple washes in PBS, slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, cat # H-1000). Images were obtained under 25\u00d7\u2009objective (LD LCI PA 25\u00d7\u2009/0.8 DIC WD\u2009=\u20090.57\u2009mm Imm Corr (UV)VIS-IR (Oil-Immersion) with a Zeiss LSM 780 Upright Multi-Photon Confocal

activated cell sorting (MACS) protocols (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.). Single testicular cell suspensions were incubated with anti-c-KIT microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec cat # 130\u2013098\u2013571) at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Following microbead binding, cells were re-suspended in autoMACS running buffer (Miltenyi Biotec cat # 130\u2013091\u2013221) and ran through LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec cat # 130\u2013042\u2013401) placed in a magnetic field. Columns were rinsed three times with buffer in autoMACS running buffer (Miltenyi Biotec cat # 130\u2013091\u2013221) before being removed from the magnetic field. MACS running/separation buffer (Miltenyi Biotec cat # 130\u2013091\u2013221) was then applied to the column before magnetically-labeled cells were flushed out by firmly pushing the plunger into the column. Cells were then centrifuged and re-suspended to a desired concentration.ATAC-seq library preparation and sequencingThe ATAC-seq libraries were prepared as previously described45 on ~30k sorted KIT+ spermatogonia, SSEA4+ SSCs or cultured ESCs.10 Briefly, collected cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10\u2009mM NaCl, 3\u2009mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) and the nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in Transposase buffer. The Tn5 enzyme was made in-house and the transposition reaction was carried out for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Following purification, the Nextera libraries were amplified for 12 cycles using the NEBnext PCR master mix (NEB cat # M0541L) and purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP\u2013PCR Purication (Beckman Coulter cat # A63881). All libraries were sequenced on a 125-cycle paired-end run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.Flow cytometry analysisCells were analyzed by flow cytometry using Aria Analyzer. For FGFR3 staining, cells were firstly incubated with anti-FGFR3 antibody (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz cat # sc-13121), washed and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-647 (anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher cat # Z25008); for TSPAN33 staining, cells were incubated with TSPAN33 PE-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems cat # FAB8405P-015); for SSEA4 staining, cells were incubated with SSEA4 VioBlue-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi Biotec cat # 130\u2013098\u2013366). Gating was based on unstained and single stained samples. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Ashland).Quantifications and statistical analysisCell type identification and clustering analysis using Seurat programThe Seurat program (http://satijalab.org/seurat/, R package, v.2.0.0) was firstly applied for analysis of RNA-Sequencing data. To start with, UMI count tables from each replicates and donors were loaded into R using Read10X function, and Seurat objects were built from each experiment. Each experiment was filtered and normalized with default settings. Specifically, cells were retained only when they had greater than 500 genes expressed, and less than 20% reads mapped to mitochondrial genome. We first ran t-SNE and the clustering analysis for each replicate, which resulted in similar t-SNE map. Next, to minimize variation between technical replicates, we normalized and combined technical replicates from the same donor using the 10\u00d7 Genomics built-in application from Cell Ranger \u201ccellrange aggr\u201d. Data matrices from different donors were then loaded into R using Seurat. Next, cells were normalized to the total UMI read count as well as mitochondrial read percentage, as instructed in the manufacturer\u2019s manual (http://satijalab.org/seurat/). Seurat objects (matrices from different donors) were then combined using RunCCA function. t-SNE and clustering analyses were then performed on the combined dataset using the top 5000 highly variable genes and PCs 1\u201315, which showed most significant p-values. Given the low number of Sertoli cells (underrepresented due to size filtering), the initial clustering analysis did not identify them as a separate cluster. We performed deeper clustering of somatic cells, identified the Sertoli cell cluster, and projected it back to the overall clusters, which resulted in 13 discrete cell clusters. Correlation of different replicates was calculated based on average expression (normalized UMIs by Seurat) in each experiment.Pseudotime and clustering analysisGerm cells (Clusters 1\u20138) from t-SNE plot were used for pseudotime analysis by slingshot (https://github.com/kstreet13/slingshot, R package, v0.1.2\u20133). Cluster 1 (SSCs) was used as start, cluster 4 (secondary spermatocytes) as middle, and cluster 8 (sperm) as end of pseudotime. After pseudotime time was determined, gene clustering analysis was performed to determine the fidelity of pseudotime. Here, cells (in columns) were ordered by their pseudotime, and genes (in rows) were clustered by k-means clustering using Cluster 3.0. Different k-mean numbers were used to reach the optimal clustering number. Genes within each gene clusters were then used to perform Gene Ontology analysis by David (v6.7).Transposable element and lncRNA analysisFirst, gtf files for TEs and lncRNAs were downloaded from UCSC and lncipedia, respectively. TE gtf was treated and filtered using the same approach as described.46 These gtf files were then used to replace the default gtf files (for genes) in Cell Ranger, and UMI count tables were generated using the same approach as described above. For downstream analysis, TE and lncRNA expression patterns were cast to the gene expression based clustering and pseudotime.Reclustering of spermatogonia/SSCs (Cluster 1 and 2)We parsed out cells in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (total number n\u2009=\u2009614), and loaded their gene expression matrices into R through Seurat. Clustering and t-SNE analyses were performed, and a small cluster (containing 24 cells) was identified as outlier and excluded from further analysis. The remaining cells (n\u2009=\u2009590) were re-clustered and analyzed using t-SNE using the top 5000 highly variable genes and PCs 1\u20135, which showed the most significant p-values. Pseudotime was performed as mentioned above using slingshot (v0.1.2\u20133).Cell cycle analysisCell cycle analysis was performed using scran program (https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/bioc/vignettes/scran/inst/doc/scran.html, R Package; v1.6.5). Briefly, cell cycle genes were obtained from scran program, and their expression in States 0\u20134 were loaded into scran. Cell cycle phases (G1, S, and G2/M) were then assigned to each single cell.Regulon analysisRegulon analysis was performed using SCENIC program (https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC, R Package; v0.1.7). State 0\u20134 cells were used to generate the regulon activity score of transcription factors as instructed by their manual. The regulon activity scores were then projected onto the t-SNE plot based on gene expression levels.RNA velocity analysisCell velocity analysis was performed using Velocyto.R program (http://velocyto.org, v0.5), as instructed.11 Briefly, at first, Velocyto used raw data to count the spliced (mRNA) and unspliced (Intron) reads for each gene, and generated a.loom file. Those.loom files were then loaded intro R (v3.4) using read.loom.matrices function to generate count tables for splicing and unsplicing reads. To generate RNA velocity map for spermatogonia, splicing and unspliced reads from States 0\u20134 were further used, and coordinates of the cells in the t-SNE plot were also provided. Lastly, the RNA velocity map was projected onto the t-SNE plot.ATAC-seq comparison analysisSAM alignments were generated from the Illumina Fastq files aligned to human hg19 genome using Novocraft\u2019s novoalign aligner (http://www.novocraft.com) with the following parameters: \u2013o SMA \u2013r ALL 50. Peak calling was performed using macs2 (https://github.com/taoliu/MACS, v2.1.2.20160309) using the following settings: \u2013g 2.7e9\u2013call-summit \u2013f BAMPE \u2013nomodel \u2013B \u2013SPMR \u2013extsize 200. Generated bedgraph file was then transformed to bw format using UCSC bedGraphToBigWig application (v4). Correlation was generated using deepTools (v3) by firstly using multiBigwigSummary bins application (with default settings) and then plotCorrelation application (with the following parameters: --skipZeros --removeOutliers). Distance of peak summit was calculated using bedtool (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/makewindows.html, v2.25.0) closestBed application.Data and software availabilityThe accession number for all sequencing data reported in this paper is GEO: GSE120508.

A major challenge is to disentangle these two types of variability and to understand the dynamic processes and mechanisms that control them. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide an ideal model system to address this issue because they exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic expression of functionally important regulatory factors. We analyzed gene expression in individual ESCs using single-molecule\u00a0RNA-FISH and quantitative time-lapse movies. These data discriminated stochastic switching between two coherent (correlated) gene expression\u00a0states and burst-like transcriptional noise. We further showed that the \u201c2i\u201d signaling pathway inhibitors modulate both types of variation. Finally, we found that DNA methylation plays a key role in\u00a0maintaining these metastable states. Together, these results show how ESC gene expression states\u00a0and dynamics arise from a combination of intrinsic noise, coherent cellular states, and epigenetic regulation.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (303KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)7Co-first authorCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Development of single-cell technologies and computational methods has enabled systematic investigation of cellular heterogeneity in a wide range of tissues and cell populations, yielding fresh insights into the composition, dynamics, and regulatory mechanisms of cell states in development and disease. Despite substantial advances, significant challenges remain in the analysis, integration, and interpretation of single-cell omics data. Here, we discuss the state of the field and recent advances and look to future opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackgroundCell-to-cell variation is a universal property of multi-cellular organisms, which contain diverse cell types characterized by different functions, morphologies, and gene expression profiles. Even within any single tissue, no matter how apparently homogeneous, there is a diverse population of cells, all of which represent different manifestations of that tissue type. Investigation of tissues or cell populations is inherently limited by the fact that the readout of any pooled assay that uses bulk tissue represents a weighted average of that population\u2019s cellular constituents. Intrinsic cellular heterogeneity is obscured in the typical ensemble studies on which the canon of modern biology and medicine is constructed.Consider, for example, the diverse repertoire of cells present in the three most rapidly self-renewing tissues in mammals: blood, skin, and the intestinal epithelium. Although the trajectory from stem to terminally differentiated cell is almost certainly a continuum of highly variable states, our limited understanding forces us to regard known stem and progenitor cell populations as discrete and stable entities. Even in post-mitotic tissues such as the adult brain, the differentiated cell states resulting from complex bifurcating developmental trajectories may also appear as a continuum. The diversity of cellular states is not only caused by their own inherent cell-to-cell variability, but also influenced by interactions among tens or even hundreds of distinct cells. These considerations question the precise boundary of a cell type and point to the need for single-cell analysis to dissect the underlying complexity and the empirical reality of stable and distinct cell states.The past few years have seen the introduction of technologies that provide genome-scale molecular information at the resolution of single cells, providing unprecedented power for systematic investigation of cellular heterogeneity in DNA [1, 2], RNA [3], proteins [4], and metabolites [5]. These technologies have been applied to identify previously unknown cell types and associated markers [6,7,8] and to predict developmental trajectories [9,10,11,12,13].Beyond expanding the catalog of mammalian cell states and identities, single-cell analyses have challenged prevailing ideas of cell-fate determination [14,15,16,17,18,19] and opened new ways of studying the mechanisms associated with disease development and progression. For example, single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) has revealed remarkable cellular heterogeneity inside each tumor, significantly revising models of clonal evolution [20,21,22], whereas single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has shed new light on the role of tumor microenvironments in disease progression and drug resistance [23].The ambitious goal of understanding the full complexity of cells in a multi-cellular organism collectively requires not only experimental methods that are considerably better than existing platforms, but also synchronous development of computational methods that can be used to derive useful insights from complex and dense data on large numbers of diverse single cells. Several recent papers have discussed various challenges critical to advance the incipient field of single-cell analysis [24,25,26,27]; here we expand on these discussions with a focus on looking to the future.Current challenges in analyzing single-cell dataWhile many methods have been successfully used for the analysis of genomic data from bulk samples, the relatively small number of sequencing reads, the sparsity of data, and cell population heterogeneity present significant analytical challenges in effective data analysis. Recent advances in computational biology have greatly enhanced the quality of data analyses and provided important new biological insights [24,25,26,27].Data preprocessingThe goal of data preprocessing is to convert the raw measurements to bias-corrected and biologically meaningful signals. Here we focus on scRNA-seq, which has become the primary tool for single-cell analysis. Gene expression profiling by scRNA-seq is inherently noisier than bulk RNA-seq, as vast amplification of small amounts of starting material combined with sparse sampling introduce significant distortions. A typical single-cell gene expression matrix contains excessive zero entries. The limited efficiency of RNA capture and conversion rate combined with DNA amplification bias may lead to significant distortion of the gene expression profiles. On one hand, even transcripts that are expressed at a high level may occasionally evade detection altogether, resulting in false-negative errors. On the other hand, transcripts that are expressed at a low level may appear abundant due to amplification biases. These errors artificially inflate the estimate of the cell-to-cell variability. While a number of methods have been developed to address this issue [28,29,30], managing dropout events continues to be a challenge. Another source of technical variation is the batch effect, which can be introduced when cells from one biological group are cultured, captured, and sequenced separately from cells in a second condition. If a scRNA-seq experiment is designed improperly, the results can be significantly affected by batch effects [31]. Furthermore, high throughput technologies typically involve multiplexing of thousands or more barcode sequences. Errors in demultiplexing may be caused by barcode impurities or external background, and dealing with them has become increasingly challenging as thousands or more cells are multiplexed by recent technologies. Finally, the cell-to-cell variation may also be attributed to cell size, cell cycle state, and other factors that are irrelevant for cell type identification. Statistical models have been developed to remove such confounding factors [27]. Together, these technical artifacts pose important challenges for data calibration and interpretation.The entanglement of technical and biological variation poses a significant challenge for evaluating data reproducibility. One approach to directly measure technical variability is to use dilute bulk RNA to approximately single-cell levels (~10\u201350\u00a0pg of total RNA) [32, 33]. However, this approach has at least two significant limitations. First, RNA purification leaves out cellular factors that may impede RNA isolation and amplification. Second, accurate dilution up to single-cell levels is technically challenging. Another approach is to use external spike-ins, such as ERCC [34]. However, this approach also has a number of limitations [35]. First, the spike-in probes typically have different molecular properties to the RNA molecules of interest. Second, the spike-in probes interact differently with respect to different molecular biology protocols. Furthermore, the dynamic range of spike-in sets like ERCC is often not optimized for the dynamic range of a typical single-cell transcriptome (~103\u2013104). As such, there is a great need to develop better-controlled methods for separating technical and biological variation. Considering these limitations, targeted approaches aimed at precise quantification of key pathways may provide more biological insights in some applications.Lack of spatial-temporal contextSingle-cell DNA-based and scRNA-based assays often contain the following steps: cell isolation; cell sorting; and library preparation and sequencing. During this process, cells are isolated from their local environment and destroyed prior to profiling. These \u201csnapshots\u201d lose important contextual information regarding both a cell\u2019s spatial environment and position within a trajectory of dynamic behavior [25]. Both sources of information are crucial to interpret the precise state of a cell at the time point of its isolation (and usually destruction).Future directionsIn situ transcriptomic analysisTo preserve spatial information, a transcriptome can be profiled in situ in fixed cells and tissues, using either in situ hybridization (ISH) or sequencing. Single molecule florescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) provides a powerful tool for detecting individual transcripts [36, 37]. Using super-resolution microscopy [38, 39], this was extended to image over a dozen messenger RNA (mRNA) in situ regardless of transcript density [40]. More recently, a temporal barcoding scheme was developed that scales exponentially with the number of hybridizations, called sequential FISH (seqFISH) [41]. In parallel, in situ sequencing methods were developed to directly sequence transcripts in tissue sections [42, 43], which has broad coverage but lower efficiency compared to FISH-based methods. More recently, a Hamming distance 2-based error correcting barcode system called merFISH [44] was developed and can be applied to long transcripts (>3\u00a0kb). This technology has recently been extended to detect 130 mRNA species [45]. Fundamentally, because of high background in tissues, smFISH-based methods are difficult to apply directly for detection of mRNAs in tissues.An amplified version of seqFISH [46], based on hybridization chain reaction (HCR) [47], allows robust detection of mRNAs in tissues and thick cleared brain samples. Combining amplification and a simple one-drop tolerant error correction scheme, this technology was applied to profile up to 249 genes, with each mRNA detected at ~80% efficiency, in over 15,000 cells in the mouse brain to resolve the structural organization of the hippocampus with single-cell resolution [48]. The authors identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone. They also found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single-cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. For imaging large samples, such as the brain, imaging speed is rate limiting, rather than the switching time between hybridizations. This is because one can toggle between two samples on the microscope, one that is being imaged and another that is being hybridized. Faster imaging modalities such as lattice lightsheet [49] and faster cameras can enable higher throughput in the number of imaged cells.Future work in spatial genomics will take several directions. First, to combine spatial transcriptome data with scRNA-seq data, one can take an approach where cell states are defined by RNA-seq and then mapped onto the spatial images and transcription profiles determined by spatial transcriptome data [50]. Second, to increase the optical space available in each cell and allow more mRNAs to be resolved spatially, expansion microscopy [51] can physically enlarge the tissue sample. An alternative image correlation approach [52] can also allow dense transcripts to be decoded. Lastly, analysis of in situ transcriptomic data requires development of new computational methods, for example, to automatically detect spatial patterns from combinations of multiple genes.Live imaging transcriptomic analysisCellular and molecular behaviors are highly dynamic and constantly changing. These dynamic behaviors greatly complicate the interpretation of snapshot single-cell analyses because individual cells will differ in their molecular state not only from other cells, but even from themselves if analyzed at a different time point [25]. Importantly, these dynamics may not represent noise, but rather a basis for important regulatory mechanisms controlling cell identity, so it is important to quantify dynamic changes and to understand their relevance [53]. Unfortunately, it is also much more difficult than static snapshot analyses. Cells must be kept alive and unchanged during the continuous and sometimes very long non-invasive analysis of their behaviors. The acquisition, handling, and analysis of time-resolved single-cell data then require specialized technical and theoretical approaches. Not only are the requirements for robustness of data acquisition technologies such as live imaging much higher than for snapshot analyses, but the resulting large and complex volumes of data require specialized solutions. These differ from tools available to analyze snapshot data and often require self-made custom developments. This holds true for the required theoretical algorithms and for user-friendly implementation [25].Lineage tracingThe objective of lineage tracing is to label the progeny of individual cells using molecular markers and use such information to reconstruct the developmental trajectories. Recently, high-throughput lineage-tracing methods have been developed using CRSIPR/Cas9-based multiplexing DNA barcodes synthesis [54,55,56,57,58]. These barcodes are stably registered in the genome and inherited during cell division and differentiation. Additional mutations are cumulated over time, through either combinatorial editing at multiple guide RNA (gRNA) target loci [54, 55, 57] or by sequential editing at a single locus [56, 58]. In the latter approach, the investigators introduced genetic mutations at the Streptococcus pyogenes gRNA-encoding sequence to circumvent the requirement of the PAM motif in gRNA recognition, enabling the resulting gRNA to repeatedly target its own locus. In addition, the DNA barcodes can be sequenced in situ, thereby preserving the spatial information [58]. Some of the aforementioned technologies have been applied to study developmental loci [54, 55, 57] and immune response [56]. In one study [54], the investigators traced the cell lineages in zebrafish and found that the majority of cells in each organ are derived from a small number of progenitor cells, whereas different progenitors are biased toward different germ layers and organs. Similar results are reported in an independent study [55]. These lineage-tracing technologies will likely have wide-ranging applications in mapping developmental and disease-progression trajectories.Single-cell multi-omicsWhile significant effort has been dedicated to improving the quality and throughput of various omic assays, work is also ongoing to develop methods to profile multiple sources of information in the same cells. Multi-omics profiling is valuable for accurate mapping of cell states and can provide insights into regulatory mechanisms. For example, genomic DNA and mRNA transcripts from the same cells can be quantified by either physical separation [59] or pre-amplification [60], followed by high throughput sequencing. In the former, extracted genomic DNA can be further processed by bisulfite conversion, leading to simultaneous quantification of the methylome and transcriptome [61, 62]. Bioinformatic analysis of the bisulfite sequencing data can further detect genetic information [63, 64]. Protein and transcriptome have also been measured in the same cells [65]. Multi-omic methods applied to single cells have revealed some surprises. For example, profiling DNA and RNA variability in single acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells suggests that genetic heterogeneity is not responsible for the diverse response of drug treatment (Enver, unpublished).Recent technologies have moved even beyond single cells to investigate sub-cellular localization of biologically active molecules. For example, nanoliter-scale cell fractionation or micro-manipulation has been applied to measure subcellular information within single cells [66]. On a different front, super-resolution imaging has been applied to map the nuclear compartmentalization of chromatin domains [67]. These subcellular data provide new insights into the precise mechanisms of various cellular processes. Ultimately, we may be able to understand phenotypic differences between genetically identical cells in terms of such variations in subcellular organization.Modeling and predictionsDifferent cell types usually arise from a linear hierarchy of differentiation stages and one goal of single-cell analysis is to identify previously unknown cell types and lineage relationships. Numerous methods have been developed to isolate similar cell types from single-cell gene expression data [7, 50, 68, 69]. Furthermore, additional methods have been developed to specifically detect rare cell subpopulations [70, 71]. To compensate for the dropout effect, methods have also been developed to impute gene expression based on similar cell types [72].Single-cell analysis has helped refine traditional views of cell differentiation. For example, a number of studies [14,15,16, 73] report evidence to suggest that megakaryocytes emerge at a \u201chigh\u201d level, approximating that of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC); this insight challenges the prevailing model that the megakaryocytic lineage emerges late in the differentiation cascade. The cell states defined by transcriptomic patterns are surprisingly continuous instead of forming distinct, transcriptionally defined groups [15, 74]. This apparent continuity of cell states poses practical challenges for cell annotation and, conceptually, implies a need for significant revisions to current models of cell-lineage hierarchy.Data from single-cell studies have enabled the development of mathematical models that represent the distribution of cell states as one sampled from a dynamic system [11, 17, 19, 73]. In this view, cell types are modeled as \u201cattractors\u201d [75], stable states that are determined by the underlying gene regulatory networks and sometimes referred to as the energy landscape. In some models, stochastic fluctuation, due to either intrinsic or extrinsic noise, may facilitate dispersion and transition between attractors [11]. Although complex, these mathematical models can be used not only to explain the continuity of cell states but also, in some cases, to predict the initiation events during cell differentiation, thereby providing mechanistic insights [11]. In a similar way, the hierarchy of cell states can be measured by entropy, which has been applied to inform cell differentiation directions [76, 77]. These new methods have opened up new ways to think about cell states, not as discrete entities, but as a continuum. To connect these two viewpoints, it is critical to determine with high precision the level of natural variation that defines the same cell type and distinguish this from the changes linked to functional state transitions. A major obstacle to achieving this goal is that the resolution of cell-state identification is limited by the quality of the underlying scRNA-seq data, which varies greatly depending on sequencing depth and other factors. Such differences have contributed to the debate over the organizing structure of the hematopoietic lineage hierarchy [15, 16].Functional validationAs single-cell data continue to grow in quality and quantity, new cell states, lineages, and associated markers are being identified at an accelerating rate. It is important to recognize that such findings are typically based on correlative analyses and that their functional relevance needs to be carefully evaluated through further experimental validation.A first level of validation is to utilize the identified markers to label the predicted cell type and visualize it in its original tissue. For example, unsupervised clustering of 25,000 single-cell transcriptomes identified 15 types of bipolar neurons [8]. The authors identified cell type-specific markers and fluorescently labeled the predicted cell types by DNA FISH. They found that the spatial organization of these predictive cell types is restricted to definitive layers and that different cell types display distinct morphologies, thereby supporting their functional identity.A deeper level of validation requires design of functional assays to demonstrate that a predicted cell type has unique properties. For example, single-cell analysis showed that common myeloid progenitors (CMP) occur in two varieties associated with differential expression of CD55 [14]. Using an in vitro colony forming assay, the investigators found that CD55+ CMP produce predominantly erythroid and megakaryocytic (MegE) colonies, whereas few MegE colonies are formed from CD55\u2013 CMP, indicating these two subpopulations are functionally different. A similar strategy has been applied to compare the functional difference between HSC subpopulations, termed MolO and NoMO [78]. These investigators found that MolO cells were enriched for higher than average CD150 and Sca-1 surface marker expression and lower than average CD48 expression.In the same vein, engineered animal models can allow isolation of cell populations and functional testing. For example, comparative scRNA-seq analysis between HSCs from young and old mice identified a gene signature associated with the MegE lineage [79]. By using a transgenic mouse strain carrying a VWF-EGFP reporter, the authors verified an increased bias toward platelet-priming HSCs in old mice.Combining scRNA-seq- and CRISPR/cas9-based perturbationsCRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens have been widely used to systematically characterize gene functions [80, 81]. Recently, this technique has been combined with scRNA-seq analysis [82,83,84,85], thereby greatly increasing the throughput of functional readouts. In these studies, gene activities are disrupted by either genetic mutations [82, 83, 85] or epigenetic inhibition [84]. gRNA-specific reporter transcripts are synthesized, which can be detected along with the mRNAs by scRNA-seq sequencing. By varying the concentration of the gRNA-containing vectors, the technique can be used to study the gene function either in isolation or in combination. In one study [82], the investigators applied this technology to analyze the effects of 24 TFs in mediating the immune response of dendritic cells. They found that the TFs form distinct modules, each targeting a common set of gene programs. Further analysis detected significant genetic interactions among a subset of TFs. In another study [83], the engineered hematopoietic progenitor cells were injected into wild-type recipient mice to evaluate their effect in hematopoiesis. This allowed them to identify a previously unknown role of Cebpb in regulating the balance between dendritic cells and monocytes during development. The combination of genome editing and scRNA-seq profiling provides a powerful tool for high-throughput dissection of gene functions and will have a wide range of applications in biomedical research.Disease applicationsGenomic profiling has been widely used to identify markers, mechanisms, and therapeutic targets of diseases. Most studies to date identify disease-related alterations by comparing genomic profiles obtained from bulk disease samples and their normal counterparts. However, these average profiles provide a distorted view of the disease sample if it contains significant cellular heterogeneity, as in cancer. Single-cell technologies have provided a set of powerful tools to dissect cellular heterogeneity and which have led to important discoveries in cancer [23,87,88,, 86\u201389] and other diseases [90, 91]. For example, multiplexing quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis has identified subtypes of leukemia cells with distinct capacities for proliferation [87, 92]. Application of scRNA-seq to cancer also led to identification of rare subpopulations associated with drug resistance [23] or self-renewal [89], whereas scDNA-seq can be used to reconstruct paths of clonal evolution [21]. Single-cell profiling will provide new opportunities for mechanistic understanding of the initiation and progression of human diseases and to develop novel treatment methods targeting specific cell types.Interdisciplinary researchWe recognize that to overcome each challenge requires significant lab and computational infrastructure resources. To move forward, the field needs groups of people with diverse expertise to work together. Interdisciplinary approaches are recognized to be important, if not a crucial prerequisite, for addressing many open questions, but also come with numerous challenges. First, the lack of expertise for parts of an interdisciplinary collaboration requires increased effort and communication. The importance of a common language is well known, but remains a significant problem in almost every new project. Ideally, this hurdle will be overcome by a new generation of students and postdocs who are educated in multiple disciplines like biology/medicine, engineering, and theoretical sciences. Interdisciplinary science, while leading to higher long-term impact, tends to be slower and published in journals of lesser impact [93] and is hard to organize and fund. Thus, it needs more patience, in particular in environments with funding cycles that require fast, short-term output. Finally, not only language, but also career paths, scientific and publication cultures, hiring procedures and age, and scientific talent, and academic motivation vary widely across disciplines. While many of these differences pose managerial challenges and should not impact scientific merit, in reality they often are the reason for failures of interdisciplinary endeavors. Overcoming these problems will require changes in teaching, funding, and publication and hiring procedures, which would benefit most areas of science, but will only have a measurable effect after a few years.ConclusionsSingle-cell analysis is an exciting and rapidly expanding field that holds tremendous potential to improve our understanding of fundamental biological problems and help us to better understand the nature and complexity of human disease in order to develop more effective therapies. To achieve these ambitious goals, proper control needs to be taken to warrant the detection of genuine heterogeneity existing in cell populations and tissue samples. In addition, we need to invest in development of new methods. Single-cell data present a number of intrinsic challenges, including systematic noise, the features of biological systems, and the sparsity and complexity of the data. The past few years have witnessed remarkable growth in the field, a trend we believe will continue, enabling more rigorous development of methods and deeper understanding of biological complexity.\n\nReferencesEberwine J, Sul JY, Bartfai T, Kim J.

PACT (passive CLARITY technique) and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ) use tissue-hydrogel hybrids to stabilize tissue biomolecules during selective lipid extraction, resulting in enhanced clearing efficiency and sample integrity. Furthermore, the macromolecule permeability of PACT- and PARS-processed tissue hybrids supports the diffusion of immunolabels throughout intact tissue, whereas RIMS (refractive index matching solution) grants high-resolution imaging at depth by further reducing light scattering in cleared and uncleared samples alike. These methods are adaptable to difficult-to-image tissues, such as bone (PACT-deCAL), and to magnified single-cell visualization (ePACT). Together, these protocols and solutions enable phenotyping of subcellular components and tracing cellular connectivity in intact biological networks.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductionBecause of their intrinsic transparency, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the zebrafish Danio rerio provide scientists with an unobstructed, organism-wide view of tissue anatomy and cellular activity via, e.g., cell type\u2013specific fluorescence labeling and genetically encoded calcium indicators1,2,3 and conventional imaging techniques4,5,6. In combination with their small size and genetic tractability, their whole-body transparency enables rigorous, high-throughput investigations into how environmental, cellular and genetic alterations influence biological processes from cellular signaling and apoptosis, to organism development and survival. By contrast, the comparatively large size and optical opacity of mammalian models generally has limited researchers to imaging snapshots of cellular organization on thin-sectioned tissue samples. However, it was hypothesized that if the bodies of these mammalian model organisms were to acquire the same level of optical transparency as zebrafish embryos, whole-body image data sets would theoretically become available to scientists for study (Table 1).Table 1 Current and potential biomedical applications of PARS and PACT.Full size tableSeveral methodologies for tissue clearing have been proposed for large-scale 3D mapping of tissue macromolecular content7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. Each of these protocols offers distinct advantages, such as preserving tissue architecture7,14,18,22,23, accommodating standard histological techniques8,15,17,18,24,25 or creating a computational workflow for acquiring and/or reconstructing thick-tissue image stacks11,15,14,26. Building on our prior CLARITY technique and concepts for generating extractable tissue-hydrogel hybrids8,27, we further developed the trio of PACT, PARS and RIMS to offer a user-friendly, rapid approach to rendering whole organs and whole organisms transparent18. These methods help to stabilize tissue architecture and preserve the macromolecular content of samples, thus enabling imaging of immunohistochemical, single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), and small-molecule staining throughout thick tissues, as well as enabling long-term storage18. In this protocol, we provide detailed information about how to implement PACT, PARS and RIMS so that users can apply these methods to their own research.Imaging of large volumes of cleared tissue can generate gigabyte- to terabyte-sized data sets, which creates new challenges associated with the computational analysis of the high-resolution image stacks. Tract-tracing in particular is a difficult and laborious undertaking, whether for mapping the brain connectome or for generating a smaller-scale wiring diagram of isolated projections between specific brain regions or of peripheral nerves at target organs. Thus, in conjunction with refining methodologies to render tissues transparent, we evaluated a wide range of image analysis software packages for their ability to process data sets of cleared brain volumes. On the basis of our findings regarding the best-performing tools, we propose here sample workflows to provide users with a springboard for basic image analysis to complement and facilitate their adoption of the PACT, PARS and RIMS methods.Advantages of tissue clearing by tissue-hydrogel hybridsThe tissue stabilization and clearing methods that we developed8,18,27 use gentle delivery of structural supportive hydrogels and removal of light-obstructing lipids through either passive clearing (PACT) or through the vasculature of intact postmortem organisms (PARS). The hydrogel mesh itself is transparent, and it secures proteins and nucleic acids into place so that we can later detect them with fluorescent labels under a microscope. There are a number of tissue clearing protocols available that combine the use of 'chemical' clearing methods (i.e., the modification and/or removal of tissue components) and 'optical' clearing methods (i.e., the homogenization of refractive indices (RIs) throughout the sample and sample mount, a feat that is usually accomplished through sample hyperhydration, dehydration and/or immersion in specially designed mounting solutions) in order to maximize sample transparency28. We experimented with many of these protocols alongside our initial development18 of PACT and PARS so that we could endeavor to incorporate some of their strengths and avoid major pitfalls. For example, we recognized the hydrogel-based tissue stabilization of CLARITY8,24 to be beneficial to sample integrity, the rapidity of 3DISCO14 and the decolorization of CUBIC11,21 to be highly desirable, and the risk of tissue damage via burning8,24 or unchecked swelling9 to be best avoided. Our observations are summarized in Table 2 to guide researchers in selecting a clearing protocol that best suits their clearing application.Table 2 Clearing techniques that multi-task: macromolecular extraction and refractive index matching.Full size tableEmerging from these different approaches to tissue clearing, PACT and PARS are notable for their versatility in preparing a variety of tissue types for high-resolution imaging at depth. The PACT hydrogel formulation and clearing process is easily optimized to render difficult-to-image tissues transparent (e.g., PACT-deCAL, for PACT delipidation and decalcification of bone), to expand tissues for better separation of compact structures (e.g., ePACT, for PACT-based expansion clearing of dense cells or projections) and to preserve tissue integrity in fragile samples through varying the degree of paraformaldehyde-tissue cross-linking. Meanwhile, PARS is positioned to tackle a variety of scientific problems that would benefit from a comprehensive, whole-body view of gene expression patterns, cellular organization and/or structural composition.PACT- or PARS-based preparation and clearing of tissue, followed by tissue mounting in RIMS, can preserve the signal from native fluorescent proteins and improve the efficacy of postclearing immunofluorescence labeling (Fig. 1). Fluorescence signal intensity is also maintained through month-long storage periods post fixation18. Other brain-specific tissue clearing protocols (Table 2) have at least one functional drawback, such as incompatibility with endogenous fluorescent labels. Some of these limitations have been overcome by the use of automated tissue sectioning techniques29,30,31,32, which have been successfully used in tracking long-range projection axons and sparse cell populations throughout whole brains in rodents or human brain sections26,33,34,35,36,37,38, or adapted to mapping the cellular organization and innervation of peripheral whole organs in mammalian tissues14,23,26,39,40,41. These heavily automated imaging systems are not readily available to biology and clinical laboratories with limited resources and budgets. Conversely, traditional histology relies on the irreversible sectioning and manual reconstruction of successive slides for image analysis, which is time-consuming and potentially loses molecular information and connectivity in the process. PACT, PARS and RIMS enable deep imaging of large tissue samples without sectioning and reconstruction. Antibody expense aside, these cost-effective techniques generate detailed 3D reconstructions of intact circuits using only mainstream single-photon microscopy.Figure 1: Applications of whole-organ and whole-organism clearing protocols.(a\u2013e) PARS-based whole-body clearing for assessing cellular-level adeno-associated virus (AAV) tropism (Supplementary Methods). Three weeks after systemic injection of AAV9:CAG-GFP, mice were PARS-cleared and their organs were excised and sectioned for imaging. (a,b) Projection images show GFP+ transduced cells in the adrenal gland. Arrow highlights a GFP+ cell near the surface of the adrenal gland with neuronal morphology, which is shown in higher magnification in b. (c) Projection images show GFP+ cells in the stomach from the surface to the lumen. GFP expression is particularly high in the myenteric plexus.

(f) A 2-mm-thick section of an adult human pancreas (top) was rendered transparent (bottom) with the PACT method. Briefly, a 2-mm-thick section was cut from a 4% PFA-fixed human pancreas, incubated in 0.5% PFA and 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide at 4 \u00b0C overnight and then polymerized in fresh A4P0 hydrogel monomer with 0.25% VA-044 thermal initiator for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The tissue was cleared with 4% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5) for 48 h, immunostained and mounted in sRIMS (\u223c50% (wt/vol) sorbitol in 0.02 M PB, RI of 1.44). (g) The islet distribution was visualized by immunostaining for insulin (red), somatostatin (green) and DAPI (cyan) (see Table 4 for details on antibodies and nuclear stain); panels represent an imaging stack of 70 \u03bcm. Magnified regions are designated by yellow and blue boxes. Sparsely distributed islets are easily located with only 5\u00d7 magnification (left). A group of islets were identified at 10\u00d7 magnification (right, top), and a 3D image of a single islet was captured with a 25\u00d7 magnification (right, bottom). All images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with the Fluar 5\u00d7 0.25 NA M27 air objective (w.d. 12.5 mm), Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 0.45 NA M27 air objective (w.d. 2.0 mm) and the LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 25\u00d7 0.8 NA Imm Corr DIC M27 multi-immersion objective (w.d. 0.57 mm). Experiments on vertebrates conformed to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations, and they were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.Full size imageExperimental designThe procedure comprises seven main stages: tissue preparation (Steps 1\u20135); formation of a tissue-hydrogel matrix (Step 6); tissue clearing (Steps 7 and 8); staining (Step 9, optional); enhancement of optical clarity using RIMS (Steps 10\u201313); imaging (Step 14); and image visualization and analysis (Steps 15\u201317). Although PACT and PARS, including their respective tissue-specific variations (PACT-deCAL, PARS-CSF18), each follow the same main stages, the decision to proceed with PACT or PARS is generally made before commencing the procedure. If the primary goal is to stabilize soft and/or amorphous samples (e.g., thymus, spleen, pancreas) for experimentation and sectioning, and not to enhance tissue transparency for imaging, users may process samples according to Steps 1\u20136 (PACT or PARS), and with the option to include bis-acrylamide and/or paraformaldehyde (PFA) in the PACT hydrogel formulation for increased sample rigidity.Required expertise.Most steps of the procedure can be performed by all members of the research community. Aspects of the PARS setup (Steps 1\u20135) require that the scientist be approved for working with laboratory animals and/or possess the surgical dexterity to establish an intravascular route for delivery of PARS reagents. For example, to execute PARS-based clearing of whole laboratory animals (e.g., rodents, nonhuman primates) via transcardial perfusion or cannulation, the researcher should be proficient in conducting animal euthanasia via transcardial perfusion and/or basic animal surgical techniques and practices.As whole-organ and thick-tissue imaging can generate tera-scale data sets, a computational or informatics background, although not necessary if relying on commercial software with good technical support, is very helpful in managing large data sets (file storage and handling) and in performing image analysis (Steps 15\u201317).PACT or PARS?Without the use of organic solvents, passively clearing and immunostaining larger tissue volumes (e.g., whole organs) is prohibitively slow. In terms of clearing efficiency, PACT18 (Figs. 1f,g and 2,3,4,5,6; Supplementary Figs. 1,2,3,4) is best suited for the quick clearing of small tissue sections (e.g., up to 1\u20133-mm-thick-sectioned organs (Supplementary Fig. 1 or tissue biopsies (Fig. 1f,g)). For whole-organ screening or profiling tissues throughout the entire organism, PARS greatly accelerates and simplifies the clearing process. All hydrogel monomer solutions, wash buffers, buffered detergents and phenotypic labels are driven throughout tissue vasculature via a perfusion-based pressure gradient (Fig. 7), which under whole-mouse or whole-rat PARS clearing renders most organs transparent within 4 d (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 5). To achieve these PARS clearing rates via PACT, excised organs would need to be thick-sectioned and processed individually or in batches, as for most other tissue-clearing protocols7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,19,20. Although the PARS setup is more involved than PACT, with the PARS tubing and reagent levels requiring attentive, daily monitoring, all organs are processed simultaneously and cleared rapidly and consistently via a single perfusion line. In addition, the basic PARS system can be obtained through the repurposing of common laboratory items (Fig. 7) and standard protocols (transcardial perfusion) within biomedical research.Figure 2: PACT setup and procedure.To successfully hybridize tissue with hydrogel monomers via free-radical polymerization, the sample and hydrogel solution must be incubated at 37 \u00b0C in an oxygen-depleted environment. This is best accomplished within an airtight container that permits sample degassing. (a) Supplies for PACT chamber (left): 50-ml conical tube (large sample) or Vacutainer (small sample), size 7 stoppers that fit the 50-ml conical tube, PTFE tubing, needles, syringes and a razor blade or scissors to cut the syringe in half. Construct a degassing line that will allow a sample tube to be evacuated of oxygen using the house vacuum and then be placed under inert nitrogen atmosphere (a, left to right). (b) The PACT procedure for sample degassing and hydrogel polymerization is as follows (b, top row): prepare the hydrogel monomer solution, taking care to keep all reagents ice-cold; infuse the tissue sample with hydrogel monomer solution at 4 \u00b0C; insert the vacuum line needle into the stopper and place the container under house vacuum for 5\u201310 min; remove the vacuum line and insert both a venting needle and the hypodermic needle, which is connected to the nitrogen gas line tubing; bubble nitrogen gas through the sample and solution for 5\u201310 min, ensuring that the venting needle allows excess pressure to escape from the PACT container; and quickly remove both needles and place the sample and container in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for 1\u20133 h. (b, bottom row) Once the hydrogel has polymerized, pour off excess hydrogel, rinse the sample with 1\u00d7 PBS and/or tissue off with a Kimwipe, section the sample (optional) and place the sample into a 50-ml conical tube filled with 8% (wt/vol) SDS clearing buffer. Incubate the sample at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking water bath until the sample is clear. Thoroughly wash the cleared sample, immunostain (optional) and then incubate the sample in RIMS to improve its optical clarity.Full size imageFigure 3: PACT protein loss and tissue expansion for different hydrogel and clearing conditions.A detailed comparison of the protein loss and tissue expansion for eight different hydrogel matrix compositions: A4P0, A4P1, A4P2, A4P4, A4P0B0.05, A4P4B0.05, A2P0B0.025 and unhybridized, and four different clearing buffers: 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5), 8% SDS-PBS (pH 8.5), 8% SDS-BB (pH 8.5) and 8% SDS in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4). Perfused and fixed mouse brains were sliced into 1-mm-thick coronal slices, and combinations of all the different hydrogel and clearing conditions were performed on slices from comparable locations. Slices were monitored and imaged every 12 h, and the clearing buffer was collected for protein loss measurements and replaced. (a) Total protein content within each sample of clearing buffer collected throughout the clearing process was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay by extrapolating the concentration of protein from a standard curve of BSA concentration in each clearing buffer (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Protein amounts from each time point were summed until each slice was completely clear, resulting in a measure for the total amount of protein lost while clearing for each slice. This total protein loss was then compared with the initial weight of each slice (n = 3). A comparison was also made with the protein loss of 100-\u03bcm-thick slices that were not cleared, but were permeabilized with PBST overnight (n = 9). (b) Comparison between total width and height tissue expansion between hydrogel compositions (n = 4). (c) Tissue expansion comparisons with different clearing conditions (n = 8). (a\u2013c) Data are presented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Experiments on vertebrates conformed to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations, and they were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.Full size imageFigure 4: Clearing time course and antibody penetration of PACT-processed samples.Quantitative comparison of the effect of different hydrogel-embedding conditions and clearing buffers on time to clear and antibody penetration during immunostaining. 1-mm-thick mouse coronal slices were hybridized and cleared with the array of previously used PACT conditions (Fig. 3). Slices were monitored for the time they took to become transparent. Once cleared, slices were washed and then immunostained. (a) Representative images of two 1-mm-thick coronal brain slices (\u223c1.0\u20130.0 mm anterior to bregma142) through the time course for PACT clearing and a comparison of time to clear (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) for each PACT hydrogel composition. For the representative images, slices were cleared with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 8.5) and incubated in RIMS for 24 h. (b) Imaging of antibody penetration through different PACT tissue preparations. Previously cleared and washed 1-mm-thick slices were immunostained for parvalbumin (red) and nuclei stained with DAPI (cyan), using 2-d incubations with the primary and Fab format secondary antibodies (for immunostaining reagents, see Table 4), transferred to RIMS for 5 h and then RIMS-mounted. Samples from the cortex, traversing the depth of the slice, were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 0.45 NA M27 air objective (w.d. 2.0 mm). To ensure even illumination throughout the depth of the slice for fair antibody detection, we applied laser power z-correction (Zen software, Zeiss): power was changed linearly for each slice, shown as a gradient next to each image; starting power values at the top were chosen to match the level of fluorescence at the surface across slices, whereas the range of powers varied for different PACT conditions. Shown are images of staining through A4P0, A4P1 and A4P4 hydrogel-embedded samples, as well as unhybridized tissue, cleared with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5). As antibody and small-molecule dye diffused through both the top and bottom surfaces of the slice simultaneously, the images show that within 2 d DAPI has fully penetrated in all of the conditions, whereas antibody labeling has progressed to varying extents, depending on the PACT condition. As slices cleared with the different conditions also swell to different extents during the process (indicated by their difference in height relative to the pre-clearing height of 1 mm, as indicated by the white dotted lines in b), penetration of antibody through a more swollen sample will either require longer diffusion time or faster diffusion rate to reach an equivalent anatomical depth as in a less swollen sample. Incomplete detection of the DAPI signal in A4P1 and A4P4 slices is due to the difficulty of achieving similar light penetration in highly cross-linked slices. (c) Depiction of parvalbumin staining through same slices as in b. DAPI signal has been removed to better show the variable penetration of the antibody over the course of a 2-d period. (d) Quantification of antibody penetration through PACT conditions depicted in b and c. Antibody fluorescence signal was scaled by the average DAPI intensity for each z-section inside the volume and the average scaled fluorescence along a line perpendicular to the tissue surface produced a final estimate of labeling intensity (in arbitrary units, a.u.) as a function of tissue depth (Supplementary Methods). Antibody diffusion was fit to an exponential model [f(x) = a \u00d7 exp (\u2212tau \u00d7 x) + b], with the exponent tau being inversely proportional to the square root of the diffusivity, wherein a larger tau indicates slower diffusion. Labeling intensities for A4P0, A4P1, A4P4 and unhybridized samples cleared with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5), as a representative sample of all the different buffers, are plotted on a logarithmic scale. The amount of PFA contained in the hydrogel-tissue matrix is inversely proportional to immunohistochemical staining efficiency. Experiments on vertebrates conformed to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations, and they were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.Full size imageFigure 5: Preservation of tissue architecture during delipidation.The differential effects of individual clearing conditions on cellular architecture and endogenous and stained fluorescence imaging. (a\u2013c) Mice that received bilateral intracranial injections in the lateral septum of AAV expressing the tdTomato transgene were perfusion-fixed with 4% PFA, and a subset of 1-mm-thick unhybridized coronal brain sections were prepared for microscopy without clearing (control, first column), or they were first rendered transparent via the CUBIC method11,21 (second column). The second subset of 1-mm-thick sections underwent PACT-processing: A4P0 embedding (third column) or A4P4 embedding (fourth column) and clearing with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5), followed by preparation for ultrastructural study or RIMS mounting. (a) Brain sections were photographed after fixation (control) or immediately after clearing (CUBIC, A4P0 and A4P4) to illustrate the degree of tissue swelling that occurred for each condition. (b) Control (unhybridized, uncleared), CUBIC-cleared and PACT-cleared (A4P0, A4P4) tissues were then processed identically for ultrastructural examination using electron microscopy and tomography (Supplementary Methods). Overviews (top row) from each of the four samples illustrate the relative amount of lipid loss attributable to the different clearing methods, in terms of contrast between structures. Tomographic reconstruction (bottom row) of subregions of the overviews, each showing a portion of an axon and surrounding cellular structures, indicates the extent of change at the fine-structural level. (c) Control, PACT- and CUBIC-cleared brain sections were mounted in RIMS or CUBIC reagent-2 (refs. 11,21), respectively, and the endogenous expression of tdTomato was imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with the LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 25\u00d7 0.8 NA Imm Corr DIC M27 multi-immersion objective (w.d. 0.57 mm). Volume renderings (top: x,y,z = 300 \u03bcm for PACT- and CUBIC-cleared samples and x,y,z = 300, 300, 140 \u03bcm for control) and maximum intensity projections (bottom: x,y,z = 100,100,50 \u03bcm) are shown. In all images except the uncleared control, cells are visualized throughout the volume imaged. In the control image, light is unable to penetrate through the sample to image at depth. (d) Preservation of myelin proteins. 200-\u03bcm-thick A4P0-PACT-cleared mouse brain sections and 50-\u03bcm-thick uncleared sections were immunostained for SMI-312 and for myelin basic protein (MBP), using Atto 488\u2013conjugated and Atto 647N\u2013conjugated Fab format secondaries (see Table 4 for details). After a 2-h RIMS incubation, the transparent sections were mounted and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with the Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 0.45 NA M27 air objective (w.d. 2.0 mm) and the LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 25\u00d7 0.8 NA Imm Corr DIC M27 multi-immersion objective (w.d. 0.57 mm). The images correspond to a 50-\u03bcm-thick maximum intensity projection over the dentate gyrus; Top: A4P0-PACT cleared, Bottom: uncleared smaller panels are high-magnification images of the boxed areas showing myelinated axons. Experiments on vertebrates conformed to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations, and they were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.Full size imageFigure 6: PACT-deCAL and optimized RIMS formulation for imaging decalcified bone samples.(a) After perfusion fixation with 4% PFA, the right and left tibia bones were dissected and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight. One tibia was reserved as the uncleared control (top left), whereas the other tibia bone was A4P0-embedded and cleared (top right) according to PACT-deCAL, as follows. The tibia bone was first cleared in 8% SDS-PBS (pH 8) for 24 h, and then it was transferred into 0.1 M EDTA for 2 d and finally cleared further in 8% SDS-PBS (pH 8) for 2 d at 37 \u00b0C. The cleared bone was washed in 1\u00d7 PBS three times over 1 d and incubated in PBS containing 1:200 DRAQ5 for 2 d at 37 \u00b0C. The stained bone was quickly rinsed in 1\u00d7 PBS and incubated in 1.49 RIMS overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The bright-field image (top right) depicts the resulting bone transparency via the placement of a ruler (small red box) underneath the tibia, wherein the tibia's outline on top of the ruler can be seen in the magnified inset of the ruler (large red box). The cleared tibia was imaged in two regions (yellow and blue boxes) on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with the LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 25\u00d7 0.8 NA Imm Corr DIC M27 multi-immersion objective (w.d. 0.57 mm). (b) RIMS may be formulated with different concentrations of Histodenz in order to achieve an RI that aligns with the tissue density and light-scattering properties of the sample to be imaged, as well as to the optical properties of the imaging setup (objective lens with or without immersion medium). RIMS with an RI \u223c1.47 is well suited for most cleared soft tissues (blue tick mark), whereas cleared bones should be incubated in RIMS with RI \u223c1.48\u20131.49 (green tick mark). Rodent husbandry and euthanasia conformed to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations; animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.Full size imageFigure 7: Assembling and working with the PARS chamber.(a) A completed PARS chamber used for whole-body tissue clearing. (b) Individual parts to build a PARS chamber: (1) three 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connectors, (2) two 3/32-inch barbed male Luers with locking nut, (3) a 1,000 \u03bcl pipette tip box, (4) a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag, (5) a three-way stopcock with Luer lock, (6) a 3/32-inch barbed female Luer with full tread, (7) a roll of lab tape, (8) a 22-G \u00d7 1-inch gavage needle, (9) a 1/8-inch barbed male slip Luer, (10) a female Luer tee with locks, (11) clay and (12) Tygon E-lab tubing. Ruler shown is 5 cm in length. (c) Three 1/8-inch holes are drilled into the pipette tip box: two into the box front and one into its side, all \u223c2 cm below the top rim of the box. The three 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connectors are placed into the drilled holes. To connect the outflow line (blue tape bands on outflow line tubing), a piece of Tygon tubing is connected from the bottom inside of the pipette box to the single 1/8-inch barbed connector that was inserted through the box side. (d) To continue the outflow line, a second, longer piece of blue-taped tubing is attached to the outer fitting of this same barbed connector (on the outside of the pipette tip box side), and then the other end of this tubing is threaded through the peristaltic pump, pulled back over toward the pipette box and finally connected to a three-way stopcock with a 3/32-inch barbed male Luer with locking nut (rightmost blue-banded tubing in d). To form the inflow line, a short length of tubing (green tape band) is used to connect the three-way stopcock to the front right 1/8-inch barbed connector of the pipette box. The solute flushing line and nitrogen bubbling line, which are subserved by the same tubing (white tape band), are formed by another short length of tubing that joins the third port of the stopcock to the front left 1/8-inch barbed connector. (e) The inflow line is continued inside the pipette box, with the tubing coiled several times around the base of the box so that the solute will be reheated before it passes through the feeding gavage into the subject. The solute flushing line and nitrogen bubbling line is continued inside the pipette tip box and taped to the bottom of the chamber (not shown). (f) The tip of the coiled inflow line tubing is threaded up through the tip wafer (see bird's-eye view of threaded wafer in a) and connected to a 22-G \u00d71-inch gavage needle with a 1/8-inch barbed male slip Luer. The gavage needle is secured with a short loop of Tygon tubing (\u223c90 mm) threaded through two holes of the wafer. (g) During the polymerization step, the chamber is placed into a 37 \u00b0C water bath and sealed in a Ziploc bag. The tubing is attached to the chamber with three 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connectors punctured through the Ziploc bag. The Tygon tubing is reconnected from the outside of the bag and surrounded with clay to make an airtight seal. (h) The animal is placed onto the pipette tip box, and the 22-G \u00d7 1-inch gavage needle is used to catheterize the heart. (i) The chamber is placed into a 37 \u00b0C water bath. A female Luer tee, which is taped onto the lid of the pipette tip box, is punctured through the Ziploc bag, and this joint is sealed with clay to ensure an airtight seal. Finally, to accelerate polymerization, a vacuum line is connected to the female Luer tee to remove oxygen (orange arrow), and a nitrogen gas line (white arrow) is connected to the 1/8-inch barbed connector to deliver a steady flow of nitrogen into the bagged system. The solute is continually circulated through the animal from the outflow line (blue arrow, which also indicates the direction of flow through blue-taped tubing) and inflow line (green arrow, which also indicates the direction of flow through green-taped tubing).Full size imageFigure 8: Whole-body clearing of mice with PARS.(a) A4P0-hybridized organs shown before the start of clearing (left) and after 5 d of clearing with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 8.5) and overnight washing with 1\u00d7 PBS at pH 7.5 (right).

Thus, the hybridization of amine-containing and PFA-cross-linked biomolecules to a hydrogel scaffold serves to stabilize tissue architecture and nonlipid content throughout all aspects of PACT and PARS tissue processing. During PARS, the rodent's intact connective tissue and inflexible skeleton provide an additional degree of structural support. To support rapid delipidation in the absence of potentially tissue damaging electrophoretic clearing (ETC)24, the composition of the PARS/PACT18 hydrogel monomer solution bares a few major changes from our originally proposed CLARITY hydrogel8, which consisted of 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide, 4% (wt/vol) PFA and 0.05% (wt/vol) bis-acrylamide (A4P4B0.05). First, the cross-linker bis-acrylamide must be excluded from the PARS hydrogel formulation to prevent hydrogel blockages in vasculature and perfusion lines. Its exclusion from the PACT hydrogel as well, and the reduced exposure of tissues to PFA in both protocols, accelerates clearing and immunolabeling steps. With a final composition of 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide and 0% PFA (A4P0), the resulting minimal polymeric scaffold of the PARS and PACT tissue-hydrogel matrices suffices not only to retain tissue proteins (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2) and stabilize tissue macrostructure18 during clearing, but it also allows SDS micelles to diffuse more freely through tissue for efficient clearing (Figs. 4a and 8; Supplementary Fig. 2c). Similarly, a lower cross-link density ensures that antibodies can better access tissue epitopes during immunolabeling (Fig. 4b\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 3e).Tissue clearing.Traditionally, tissue clearing protocols have aimed to render samples transparent via homogenizing the RIs of the various tissue components, and matching their RIs with the lens and mounting setup (e.g., glass coverslip interfaces). This has often been accomplished via exchanging the aqueous fraction of tissue (RI \u223c1.33) with a mounting medium of higher RI, which includes organic solvents such as BABB (RI \u223c1.53\u20131.57)13,14,42, dibenzyl ether (RI \u223c1.56)12,23, methyl salicylate (RI \u223c1.52\u20131.54)43 and 2,2\u2032thiodiethanol (RI \u223c1.52)44; polyol and saturated sugar solutions such as glycerol (RI \u223c1.43\u20131.47)8, sucrose and fructose (RI \u223c1.49\u20131.50)7,22; and amides such as formamide (RI \u223c1.44)10 and urea (RI \u223c1.38)9,11. Aside from passive CLARITY15 and PACT18, few passive clearing protocols endeavor to alter the chemical composition of tissue, by removing major tissue components from samples so that they become less light-scattering (see 'Chemical clearing' in Table 2). One notable example is CUBIC11,21, which also combines the use of passive delipidation and RI matching to achieve transparency. Thus, we sought to compare the level of delipidation that was achieved with PACT-based clearing (A4P0 and A4P4 hydrogels) and CUBIC-based clearing. To examine the efficacy of tissue delipidation, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 5b and Supplementary Methods). Indeed, as illustrated by membrane permeabilization and extraction, lipid removal was noticed in all conditions, and it was highest in A4P0, in which a high degree of fine structure loss is evident. In contrast, A4P4 tissue, although extracted, still retains enough contrast for identifying fine structural detail, such as membrane-bound organelles and small neurites. With respect to structural preservation, the CUBIC samples are between the two PACT conditions, showing nearly complete lipid extraction but with some cytoskeletal elements in the axon preserved. Although samples embedded in A4P0 hydrogel showed adequate protein and nucleic acid retention for imaging endogenous fluorescence (Fig. 5c) and detecting myelin-binding proteins (Fig. 5d), if an enhanced level of tissue preservation is desired it is best to embed samples in a hydrogel with a higher order of tissue cross-linking by including PFA (for example, by adding 1\u20134% (wt/vol) PFA to the 4% acrylamide hydrogel solution, termed A4P1-4). Alternatively, samples can be processed in parallel, and adjacent areas can be directed either to TEM or to hydrogel-embedding and clearing to obtain both ultrastructural and volume information, respectively.The denaturing anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), used for lipid removal in PACT/PARS, is also very effective in dissociating DNA from proteins (e.g., for cell nuclei removal) and in disrupting extracellular matrices to facilitate protein removal (e.g., ionic interactions of SDS with membrane proteins allow for their removal and purification). For example, retrograde perfusion of a cadaveric rat heart with 1% (wt/vol) SDS for 12 h results in its complete decellularization45. By contrast, SDS solubilization of lipid bilayers via a micellar mechanism is a slower process. Thus, to guard against the extraction of peptide and nucleic acid content during SDS clearing, it is important that nonlipid tissue components have been hybridized to a hydrogel scaffold.In the initial Nature paper describing CLARITY8, the dense tissue-hydrogel cross-linking conferred by A4P4B0.05 tissue embedding prohibited rapid passive clearing of large tissue blocks24. The advanced CLARITY protocol15 suggests decreasing acrylamide concentrations to as low as 0.5% (A0.5P4B0.0125) when clearing is performed passively rather than with ETC-based rate enhancement. After the initial, thorough perfusion-fixation step with 4% PFA, PACT and PARS tissues are infused with A4P0 monomer18. Although bis-acrylamide may be included in the hydrogel formulation to stabilize fragile samples, we have not found the addition of bis-acrylamide to be beneficial in preventing protein loss (Fig. 3a) in either A4P0-hybridized (A4P0B0.05) or A4P4-hybridized (A4P4B0.05) tissues. Furthermore, although protein retention is similar for all A4P0-4 formulations (Fig. 3a), higher concentrations of PFA, which anchors tissue to the hydrogel mesh and increases tissue cross-linking, result enhanced fine structure preservation (Fig. 5b) and limits anisotropic tissue-hydrogel expansion (Fig. 3b,c). The resulting less-porous tissue-hydrogel matrix curtails protein solubilization by SDS (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2b); clearing speed (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 2c), overall tissue transparency (Fig. 4a) and the efficiency of antibody labeling (Fig. 4b\u2013d) are all reduced. Thus, PFA-containing hydrogel formulations are only recommended for samples that will be used for in-depth profiling of fine structures, in which protein and nucleic acid retention is of maximum importance.The importance of pH and temperature in clearing.Here we describe two modes of detergent-based tissue clearing: passive lipid removal (PACT: Step 6A for hydrogel permeation and embedding, Step 7A for PACT clearing) and active delipidation (PARS: Step 6B for hydrogel perfusion and embedding, Step 7C for PARS clearing). Several factors, including the chemical properties of the detergent solution, the pH of the detergent solution46 and the tissue components to be extracted (i.e., peptide, lipid and nucleic acid), affect micelle formation and composition, and hence the clearing efficiency. The role of pH is heightened in scenarios, such as tissue clearing, in which relatively high SDS concentrations (4\u20138% (wt/vol) SDS) are used. A slightly basic clearing solution will help to counteract proton buildup at the negatively charged surface of SDS micelles47. Conversely, a clearing solution that becomes too acidic has the potential to impair lipid extraction by disrupting the structure of the ionic micelles, as well as to encourage protein extraction via their denaturation and release from membranes. For these reasons, and to avoid damage to tissue and to endogenous fluorescent proteins48, it is important to maintain a physiological to slightly basic pH during tissue clearing. Among the alkaline buffers that are best suited for PACT and PARS are 0.2 M boric acid (pH = 8.5) and 0.01 M PBS (pH = 7.5 (ref. 18) and 8.5), with the more basic 8% (wt/vol) SDS solutions offering a slight rate enhancement to delipidation (Supplementary Fig. 2c).Temperature represents a second important factor that influences the solubilization process, and, in particular, the micellular composition49. For SDS in aqueous medium, the average micelle volume decreases, but the total number of micelles increases as the temperature rises50. It is hypothesized that smaller micelles may more readily diffuse through the tissue-hydrogel matrix, and thus increasing the temperature of the clearing bath will accelerate lipid extraction. Higher temperatures (\u223c50 \u00b0C), which may enhance clearing efficiency7,15, will promote protein denaturation, which has the potential to damage relevant protein epitopes or to incur fluorescent protein signal loss. Thus, both PACT and PARS clearing steps are performed at 37 \u00b0C. To accelerate lipid extraction, the concentration of SDS is raised from 4% to 8% (wt/vol) SDS relative to CLARITY, which has a similar effect as raising the clearing temperature.Labeling.PACT- and PARS-prepared tissues are amenable to most standard histological techniques, including those that use immunohistochemical, small-molecule and fluorescent protein\u2013based labels, as well as bright-field stains. Small-molecule dyes such as nuclear stains rapidly distribute throughout thick tissue sections, such that hour-long to overnight incubations are sufficient for most samples. The slow diffusion of full-format antibodies (150 kDa) through thick samples, and their tendency to denature and degrade over time, necessitates the use of, on average, tenfold more concentrated antibody dilutions in primary and secondary incubations of thick sections than in 40-\u03bcm-thin sections. The use of smaller antibody formats (fragment antigen-binding (Fab): 55 kDa, Fab dimer (F(ab\u2032)2): 110 kDa,) for secondary antibody labeling is suggested, particularly given their commercial availability. Herein, we can achieve adequate labeling of 1-mm-thick sections by Fab format antibodies within 48 h. Even smaller formats, most notably camelid nanobodies (15 kDa)51,52, are ideally suited for labeling thick tissue (Supplementary Fig. 6), as at 10\u00d7 smaller than full IgGs they penetrate tissue rapidly and thoroughly. In addition, their stability (e.g., over a wide pH range, at high concentrations, and at temperatures of up to 90 \u00b0C) and protease resistance allows them to remain intact throughout long incubations conducted at room temperature (RT, 18\u201325 \u00b0C) (Supplementary Fig. 6b).Enhancement of optical clarity.Infusing and mounting cleared tissues in RIMS helps to minimize the mismatch between the RIs of the sample and the microscope objective. This so-called optical clearing, which is detailed in Steps 10\u201313, greatly enhances the optical clarity of cleared samples (Figs. 1a\u2013e, 2b, 4, 5a,c,d, 6a and 8; Supplementary Figs. 3, 5 and 6b). One could substitute a different mounting solution for RIMS (e.g., sRIMS (Fig. 1f,g), cRIMS, glycerol dilution, FocusClear24, Cargille Labs optical liquids15 and 2,2\u2032-thiodiethanol44). Optionally, one could measure the RI of the chosen mounting medium using a refractometer, dilute glycerol with ddH2O to the same RI, and then use this glycerol dilution as the immersion medium for dipping objectives.Imaging.To use tissue clearing to its best advantage, the microscope setup must be capable of acquiring high-resolution image stacks through thick, cleared samples. Of utmost importance are the detection optics. A high numerical aperture (NA \u223c1.0) and long-working distance (w.d. = 5\u201310 mm) objective will provide high resolving power even when viewing deep tissue structures. In addition, as objectives are designed according to the optical properties of a target sample and sample mount, an objective that has been optimized to the RI range of the RIMS-mounted tissue and immersion medium (RI \u223c1.46\u20131.49) will minimize spherical aberrations, maximize lateral and axial resolution and help preserve fluorescent signal intensity while imaging through thick, cleared tissues. To this end, numerous manufacturers have developed specialized multi-immersion and air objectives that are well suited to imaging PACT- and PARS-cleared fluorescent samples at depth: e.g., Olympus 10\u00d7 0.6 NA UIS2-XLPLN10XSVMP and 25\u00d7 1.0 NA UIS2-XLSLPLN25XGMP objectives (w.d. 8.0 mm) for samples with RI \u223c1.33\u20131.52 and RI \u223c1.41\u20131.52; Leica HC FLUOTAR L 25\u00d7 1.0 NA IMM motCORR VISI (w.d. 6.0 mm) for samples with RI = 1.457; Zeiss Scale-optimized 20\u00d7 1.0 NA objective (w.d. 5.6 mm) for samples with RI = 1.38; and Zeiss CLARITY/CUBIC-optimized EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 5\u00d7 0.16 NA objective and LSFM clearing 20\u00d7 1.0 NA objective (w.d. 5.6 mm) for samples with RI = 1.45.Imaging cleared tissues via two-photon or confocal microscopy can generate extremely high-resolution data sets. However, these imaging modalities are time-consuming, particularly when scanning a large field of view at depth. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) permits rapid scanning through comparatively large sample volumes, which alleviates the imaging bottleneck that can occur with the high-throughput preparation of cleared samples. In addition, because image acquisition requires only brief plane illumination, LSFM minimizes sample photobleaching, a major drawback in using point-scanning confocal systems to image large fluorescently labeled samples. Given the widespread availability of confocal microscopes but the obvious benefits of LSFM, we provide imaging guidelines for each system, as well as design schematics for a cost-efficient LSFM system (Fig. 9).Figure 9: Light-sheet microscopy enables fast and high-resolution imaging of cleared samples.(a) A schematic diagram of the light-sheet microscope; M, mirror; DM, dichroic mirror; S, sample; EF, emission filter. The scientific CMOS camera (Zyla 4.2 sCMOS, Andor) is running in a light-sheet mode, in which the readout direction of the camera is unidirectional and synchronized with the scanning direction and speed of the light source. In this configuration, only the pixels that are illuminated will be recorded, thus improving the signal to noise ratio of the image. For ease of synchronization, the function generator, the camera and the oscilloscope are controlled using a custom MATLAB program. (b) An image of the 3D-printed immersion chamber (see design in Supplementary Data 1), in which the CLARITY objective (Olympus 25\u00d7 1.0 NA multi-immersion objective, w.d. 8.0 mm) is immersed in glycerol, whereas the sample is within a quartz cuvette filled with RIMS. (c) A volume rendering (Imaris, Bitplane) and cross-sections at different depths of a cleared Thy1-YFP mouse brain section (1 mm thick), taken with the light-sheet microscope. The intensity of the layers was normalized as per Imaris image processing function, i.e., the mean and s.d. of each layer were equalized to the mean and s.d. of the entire stack using linear transformation. The images were acquired at 45 frames per second (voxel size: 0.117 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.117 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm, bit depth: 12). The cross-sections at different depths, which are perpendicular to the scan direction, are maximum intensity projections (Imaris) across a 5-\u03bcm volume. A parts list for this setup is available in Supplementary Table 1.Full size imageData analysis.Following on the heels of the 'OME' focus of the past few decades53 and spurred by the efforts of the BRAIN Initiative (http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/index.htm), the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu) and the Allen Brain Institute, the quest to map the human connectome has recently taken center stage. It is unlikely that the connectome project can be tackled by a select few taking a top-down approach, as was possible in the elucidation of the human genome54,55. Instead, by tasking multiple groups with mapping discrete neural circuits, one can envision the draft of a connectome gradually emerging through stitching together these individual wiring diagrams (e.g., http://www.openconnectomeproject.org)56,57,58. When combined with long-working-depth objectives and high-throughput imaging (LSFM, e.g., CLARITY optimized light-sheet microscopy15; and the custom-made, economical system presented here in Fig. 9, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Data 1 and 2), PACT and PARS provide a means for efficiently acquiring information on the spatial position of neurons within large tissue volumes at high resolution. For this information to be applied to mapping the connectome59, however, these gigabytes or even terabytes of raw image data (e.g., for a whole mouse brain at 25\u00d7 magnification) must be converted into a complex network of neuron projection pathways and neural contacts, a feat that poses substantial demands on both storage hardware and image analysis software. Many available software tools and image file formats were not designed with tera-scale data sets in mind and assume that entire image volumes fit in computer RAM.To this end, we have evaluated a range of software packages for processing, visualization and analysis of cleared brain volumes, including both general image processing platforms and more specialized tools focused on stitching or filament tracing. Table 3 includes a summary list of those tools that we found to be stable, functional, user-friendly and well supported. For general image analysis, we recommend Fiji60 (a distribution of ImageJ61) and Vaa3D62,63, which are open-source, extensible platforms for image analysis and visualization that have a rich collection of plug-ins for carrying out specific tasks including stitching and fiber tracing64,65,66. We recommend neuTube67 for semiautomated tracing of neurites (Fig. 10a and Supplementary Fig. 7a; see Supplementary Data 3 for the raw 3D image stack from which the neuTube traces were generated). Commercial software packages Imaris (Bitplane) and Neurolucida68 provide similar functionality, currently offer better support for very large image files and can be more stable and user-friendly (Fig. 10b and Supplementary Fig. 7b; see Supplementary Data 3 for the raw 3D image stack from which the Imaris traces were generated)\u2014making them a good starting point for laboratories with less image-processing expertise.Table 3 Image analysis and visualization tools.Full size tableFigure 10: Two different workflows for cell tracing in neuTube and Imaris.(a) Tracing using neuTube67. (b) Tracing using Imaris 7.1 (Bitplane). Results shown here took 25 min for a novice user with \u223c5 h of total experience using each tracing tool.

The original test mage on which semiautomated tracing was performed is provided in Supplementary Data 3.Full size imageImage stitching.Confocal and light-sheet microscopes equipped with motorized stages usually support tiled acquisition, which is essential for imaging large volumes at cellular resolution. These tiles can then be aligned to pixel accuracy and blended together using microscope acquisition software such as Leica Application Suite (Leica Microsystems), Zen (Zeiss), cellSense (Olympus) and NIS Elements (Nikon Instruments), or manipulated off-line using open-source tools such as the TeraStitcher69, the Vaa3D iStitch plug-in70, the ImageJ stitching plug-in71, and XuvTools72.When stitching together multiple tiles, systematic variations in brightness across the image field caused by nonuniform illumination, vignetting or imprecise optical alignment often result in significant variations in image brightness that can make downstream visualization and processing difficult. One solution is to capture smaller tiles from the central field of view where illumination tends to be more uniform. However, this increases capture time, as, for example, reducing the field of view to the center one-third requires capturing and stitching nine times as many tiles. An alternate approach is to directly measure the illumination profile using a uniform calibration slide (e.g., see protocols73 and 'How flat is your confocal illumination profile?

This so-called 'flat field' or shading correction from a reference image is often supported by acquisition software such as the \u03bcManager MultiChannelShading plug-in (see http://nic.ucsf.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=flatfieldimageacquisition and ref. 75), shading reference in NIS Elements (Nikon Instruments), Leica Application Suite (Leica Microsystems), Zen (Zeiss) and cellSense (Olympus), or it can be carried out using an off-line workflow such as with the ImageJ ImageCalculator; see 'How to correct background illumination in bright-field microscopy' by G. Landini at http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=howto:working:how_to_correct_background_illumination_in_brightfield_microscopy.Visualization.Image stacks can be visualized using commercial software such as Imaris (Bitplane), Amira (FEI), MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) and others (Zen (Zeiss), Leica Application Suite (Leica Microsystems), NIS Elements (Nikon Instruments), cellSense (Olympus), MetaMorph (Molecular Devices), Volocity (PerkinElmer), Huygens (SVI), Arivis Vision4D (Arivis), or using free or open-source tools such as Fiji 3D Viewer76, Vaa3D62, Icy77, BioImageXD78, VolView (Kitware, see http://www.kitware.com/opensource/volview.html) or Bioview3D79. These tools all support 3D volumetric rendering of image data that can be interactively rotated and zoomed by the user, as well as functionality for selecting subvolumes, virtual 2D sectioning, image contrast and other color-map adjustments and manual annotation. Here we provide example workflows and estimated processing times based on tests with a large tiled image, 144 fields of view taken on an LSM 780 at 5\u00d7 magnification, stitched in ZEN (Zeiss) to produce a single channel, 8-bit, 30-GB image stack of size 3.3 \u00d7 1010 voxels (16,384 \u00d7 9,216 \u00d7 220) covering \u223c1.165 mm3 (2.72 \u00d7 1.53 \u00d7 0.28 mm) of tissue.Stitching very large acquisition volumes can easily produce image files that are too slow to load and display directly on machines with limited memory. Table 3 indicates which software tools support 'out of core' visualization, using read on demand, caching and multiresolution representations to process and visualize data sets that are too large to fit in memory while preserving interactivity. In particular, TeraFly69, Imaris (Bitplane) and BigDataViewer80 (Fiji, see http://fiji.sc/BigDataViewer) use custom multiresolution, tiled file formats for storing image data on disk. This aids interactive visualization (even on machines with substantial amounts of RAM), as low-resolution views can be displayed quickly with higher-resolution detail filled in as soon as it can be read from disk.Morphometric analysis.Tracing of neurites can be carried out using plug-ins provided in general processing tools such as Imaris Filament Tracer (BitPlane), Amira Skeletonization plug-in (FEI), Metamorph NX Neurite Tracing (Molecular Devices), Fiji Simple Neurite Tracer64,81 and Vaa3D-Neuron266. Alternatively, one can use special-purpose software such as Neurolucida68, neuTube67, Neural Circuit Tracer82, flNeuronTool83, Farsight trace editor84, Neuron Studio84 and Neuromantic85. Several of these tools provide automated or semiautomated workflows that allow a user to trace neurites by clicking on a few points along a given neurite, which can greatly accelerate initial tracing of long-range projections. The 3D Image Analysis workflow below gives estimates of time required to produce a rough-draft trace for a test image (Supplementary Data 3). Semiautomated tracing tools are computationally intensive and currently have slow performance on volumes larger than a few gigabytes. Efficient use of these tools thus requires manual selection or cropping of regions of interest (ROIs) during annotation, and the resulting traces need to be merged in a post-processing step.Morphology of traced neurites can be saved in SWC (a standard file format developed by the Southampton Neurosciences Group; see the SWC file format specifications on the Computational Neurobiology and Imaging Center of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine website: http://research.mssm.edu/cnic/swc.html), NeuroML86 or NEURON .hoc file formats, which in turn can be used with a wide range of downstream neuroinformatics tools87,88 including statistical morphometry (e.g., Scorcioni et al.89), assembly and simulation of biophysical models (e.g., Gleeson et al.90) and deposition in online searchable databases (e.g., http://www.neuromorpho.org/ (ref. 91)).Applications of the methodPACT, PARS and RIMS clear a variety of tissues, from laboratory mice and rats (organs and adult whole bodies) to primates (Fig. 1f,g, tumor biopsy18), and they are compatible with endogenous fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, long-term sample storage18, smFISH and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution18. Furthermore, the potential exists to apply PARS to the clearing and staining of large, isolated whole organs when the vasculature is preserved during organ excision92,93. Akin to paraffin embedding, the increased rigidity of hydrogel-embedded, uncleared samples may allow unstructured soft tissues (e.g., pancreas, thymus) and amorphous biological samples (e.g., sputum) to be stabilized for manual sectioning, as well as for automated slicing and imaging systems, such as serial two-photon tomography29,37. When these tissue-hydrogel hybrids are cleared with PACT or PARS rather than thin-sectioned for imaging, whole organs and thick tissue blocks become amenable to visualization with modern microscopy methods such as LSFM (which rapidly scans large sample volumes, thereby minimizing photobleaching but maximizing the phenotypic content within the image stack) and super-resolution microscopy29,37. Bridging these microscale and nanoscale imaging modalities, the recent method of expansion microscopy (ExM)94 recruits a by-product of CLARITY8 and PACT18 hydrogel-embedding, namely the capacity to absorb water, to great advantage. By deliberately swelling tissue-hydrogel hybrids, isotropically expanded tissues can be mined for qualitative information of subcellular structures at synaptic resolution using only a conventional confocal microscope.Accelerating biomedical discovery with tissue clearing.The current and potential biomedical applications of PARS and PACT are summarized in Table 1. PARS and PACT enable detailed structural information from peripheral tissue and organ samples to be obtained, aiding in the study of distinct cellular populations or environments within their unsevered tissue milieu. For example, stem cell niches embedded within relevant tissue environments, such as small intestinal crypts95,96 and the bone marrow97, can be studied. Tumor architecture and morphology can be mapped98, including tumor margins, tumor vascularization, cellular heterogeneity and metastatic foci across the entire organism, for both research and diagnostic purposes. Whole-body optical clearing by PARS and imaging could facilitate obtaining better peripheral nerve maps39,99, which can then facilitate an understanding of the neural processing that accompanies peripheral nerve/organ function and dysfunction41.Importantly, PARS may also facilitate whole-body screening of therapeutics for off-target and on-target binding, and for imaging the biodistribution of administered agents as a method for the qualitative determination of their pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties. Similarly, PARS can be used to expedite the slow, labor-intensive process of screening novel viral vector variants for specific tropism characteristics. Typically, researchers perform conventional tissue slicing and histology on numerous tissues across multiple samples, which is an exceedingly laborious process. Whole-body screening through PARS can improve throughput and reduce the risk of sampling errors.The described protocols for tissue stabilization and lipid removal allow for rapid phenotyping of whole organs and whole organisms, and therefore they could advance biomedical research with respect to the study of changing tissue pathology during aging or during disease progression. One obstacle to studying the progression of cell death that occurs during neurodegeneration (e.g., in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke) is the inability to visualize cells that have already died and have been removed by macrophages before the tissue was dissected for histological analysis. A similar cellular mapping confound exists in ablation experiments, wherein toxins are used to damage cells for studies that aim to causally link the function of a defined neuronal population (compact or sparsely distributed) to brain activity and behavior. The postquantification is rarely accurate, as it relies on inferring the exact distribution of ablated cells on the basis of their representative distribution in placebo-treated brains. By combining PARS with TEMPEST27\u2014a precursor to CLARITY\u2014the in vivo expression of long-lasting keratin filaments (that outlive the cells themselves while keeping a loyal blueprint of the morphology) within populations of interest can facilitate accurate postmortem quantification and brain-wide mapping of long-degenerated cells.Size fluctuations in tissue-hydrogel hybrids: challenge and opportunities.Most protocols that render tissues transparent cause notable sample volume fluctuations. In general, clearing protocols that entail dehydration steps for clearing with organic solvents or some concentrated RI-matching solutions cause tissue shrinkage, whereas protocols that involve prolonged incubations in aqueous detergent-based solutions tend to cause gradual tissue expansion (Table 2)7,9,22,100. In part a consequence of the water-absorbing properties of polyacrylamide, a nitrogen-containing derivative of the super-absorber polyacrylic acid, tissue-hydrogel expansion has previously been reported with CLARITY and PACT-processing8,18 (Fig. 3b,c), and indeed it has been used to great advantage in ExM94. Several factors have been shown to influence the swelling properties of water-absorbing hydrogels. The most notable are pH; the dissolved ion content of the aqueous swelling medium (i.e., clearing buffer) and the tissue-hydrogel microstructure, including the ordering of monomeric units within a polymerized hydrogel; the degree of cross-linking; and the mechanical rigidity of the embedded tissue. With respect to tissue clearing, as detergent gradually solubilizes and extracts tissue biomacromolecules, not only can water migrate into this additional space in the tissue-hydrogel matrix but also there is less mechanical resistance from tissue components to polymer swelling as water continues to diffuse in.For neuron tracing and brain mapping purposes (i.e., connectomics101, expansion-contraction cycles should be minimized so as not to sever fine processes, distort the spatial arrangement of cells within local niches or alter cellular connectivity7. Similarly, gross size changes, particularly when anisotropic, complicate image registration with existing atlases such as the Allen Brain Atlas102 We have previously proposed a few modifications to passive CLARITY-based protocols in order to counteract tissue expansion that occurs during clearing and to minimize the occurrence of morphological artifacts that could be introduced with fluctuating tissue size7,9,100 They include using in-skull clearing protocols (e.g., PARS-CSF18 and PARS, see Figs. 7 and 8; Supplementary Fig. 5); extending the postfixation step for perfused, excised organs, including the brain, before the start of any clearing protocol; and/or performing PACT with a hydrogel monomer formulation that contains increasing amounts of PFA (e.g., a hydrogel solution of 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide and 1\u20134% (wt/vol) PFA, A4P1\u20134)). With respect to the latter, the inclusion of PFA in hydrogel monomer compositions not only combats hydrogel swelling but also the expansion becomes increasingly isotropic (Fig. 3b). Thus, for improved tissue preservation, it is advisable to supplement the A4P0 hydrogel recipe with PFA (1\u20134% PFA in the monomer solution).The inclusion of PFA in monomer solutions also curtails tissue size changes in mounting medium. Upon their initial immersion in RIMS, tissue samples contract during the first hour (\u223c20% for A4P0-embedded coronal rodent brain sections), followed by a gradual rebound back to their pre-RIMS size. Imaging during this time window should be avoided, as these slight size fluctuations could introduce apparent tissue deformities or sample drift issues during image acquisition. With adequate equilibration in RIMS (e.g., hours to days, depending on sample size, tissue permeability and so on), sample size and transparency will reach a steady state for high-resolution, deep imaging18.It follows that a motivating factor behind the development of PARS was to neutralize this potential risk of tissue expansion during clearing. Although the tissue becomes more permissive to hydrogel swelling as lipid membranes are permeabilized and extracted, the skin encasing, bone structure and connective tissue will continue to restrict water absorption by the hydrogel and thus minimize size changes of the internal organs. Consequently, the addition of PFA to the PARS monomer solution is not necessary.However, swelling\u2014if isotropic\u2014can be advantageous. By expanding hydrogel-embedded tissue uniformly, dense cell populations can be distributed spatially for cell counting or for analyzing local cell contacts (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods); similarly, dense cell and/or fiber tracts, such as the corpus callosum, the spinal cord and individual muscles, may be expanded for easier anatomical study. For example, ExM recently recruited the swelling properties of CLARITY tissue-hydrogel hybrids8,18 to visualize samples at nanometer resolution94 Through altering the monomer components and concentration, scientists may quickly adjust the overall volume occupied by the hydrogel-embedded tissues, shrinking tissues to fit within the working distance of an objective or swelling tissues for facile high-resolution imaging of diffraction-limited spots103 Such measurements require separate validation with well-established super-resolution microscopy methods104,105,106,107,108 until one can confirm that specimen preparation does not introduce anisotropic distortions.Limitations of the methodAs discussed in the previous section, some tissue deformation is expected with all tissue clearing protocols (see examples in Table 2), wherein the tendency for tissue to expand and/or shrink moderately during sample clearing and/or mounting is frequently noted7,8,10. Whether these volume changes cause structural damage that would confound the interpretation of sample images is widely debated. Although we have observed some tissue swelling during PACT and PARS clearing, tissues subsequently contract to approximately their original size in RIMS medium. Although it is difficult to test exhaustively by individual efforts, the net impact of these changes on overall cellular architecture appears to be minimal, as demonstrated by the preservation of fine cellular morphology across a range of tissue types18. However, such changes in tissue volume could complicate image registration. To compare an image stack of an experimental sample with a representative data set or with a reference atlas, it will be necessary to use structural landmarks or tissue stains rather than the sample size to align images. Validated tissue stains that can help with registration include the following: Nissl or Golgi stain for the brain; membrane and organelle stains, including the use of lectins to label vascular networks, as well as H&E stain to simultaneously visualize hematoxylin-stained nucleic acid and eosin-stained red blood cells, cytoplasmic material, cell membranes and extracellular structures and protein; and fuchsin to label collagen, smooth muscle or mitochondria. Finally, unstained structural components (e.g., distinctive neuron arborization109, large tissue structures110 and cortical surfaces110,111,112 can be imaged at lower resolution to create reference images to aid in registering high-resolution, small volumes113) and artificial landmarks (e.g., gold-seeding or quantum dot deposition114, electron microscopy (EM) platform grids for serial section mounting and imaging115) may be used as fiducial markers for registering sample data sets collected during light and electron microscopy, as well as for cross-referencing in vivo imaging scans with subsequent ex vivo data sets.To image whole organs or thick tissue sections, the image data file sizes will be tera-scale; thus, it is important to use a computational workstation with substantial RAM (this will be highly dependent on the individual software requirements, user-specific variables such as the average file size and the desired image analysis capabilities). Our experience showed that as much as 64\u2013256 GB might be needed, depending on data and analysis type, multicore CPUs and an excellent graphics card (e.g., Windows platform: AMD Radeon R9 290X 4.0 GB; Mac platform: AMD FirePro D700 6 GB).MaterialsREAGENTS\n\n\nSample to be imaged.

The pH may be adjusted with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, as needed. The resulting 1\u00d7 PBS should have a final concentration of 10 mM PO4, 137 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl. Alternatively, purchase 10\u00d7 PBS premade solution (e.g., Lonza, cat. no. 17-517Q) from a commercial supplier.\n\n\nHeparinized PBS (hPBS)\n\nFor flushing vasculature of blood at the start of perfusion, prepare 1\u00d7 PBS with 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium nitrite and 10 units per ml heparin, pH 7.4. Place it on ice until use or refrigerate it for up to a few weeks.\n\n\n4% PFA (for perfusion fixation)\n\nTo prepare 40 ml of 4% PFA (wt/vol, final concentration), combine 4 ml of 10\u00d7 PBS, 5 ml of 32% (wt/vol) PFA solution and 31 ml of ice-cold water. Adjust the pH to 7.4 and keep it on ice or refrigerate it until use (same day).\n\n\n1\u00d7 PBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (PBST)\n\nAdd 1 ml of Triton X-100 to 1\u00d7 PBS for a total volume of 1 liter; adjust the pH to 7.4. PBST may be stored at RT for a few months when it is filter-sterilized; vortex or stir the solution on a stir plate for several minutes before use.\n\n\nBoric acid buffer (BB)\n\nPrepare a 1 M boric acid buffer stock solution by stirring 61.83 g of boric acid and 10 g of NaOH in 900 ml of water with gentle heating. Once sodium hydroxide pellets and boric acid are fully dissolved, adjust the pH to 8.5 with NaOH and add water to a total volume of 1 liter; store it at RT for up to a few months. To prepare fresh borate-buffered clearing solutions, such as 8% (wt/vol) SDS in 0.2 M BB at pH 8.5 (8% SDS-BB) for PACT and PARS, dilute 400 ml of 20% (wt/vol) SDS and 200 ml of 1 M boric acid buffer stock to 1 liter with distilled and deionized water (ddH2O); adjust the pH to 8.5, if necessary. To make a boric acid wash buffer (BBT, 0.2 M boric acid buffer with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, pH 8.5), dilute the 1 M boric acid stock to 0.2 M boric acid in ddH2O, adding 1 ml of Triton X-100 per liter of BBT and stirring on a stir plate for 10 min. BBT may be stored at RT for several weeks, barring contamination; vortex the solution or stir it on a stir plate for several minutes before use.\n\n\nPACT monomer solution\n\nFor rapid preparation of samples that are amenable to both standard immunohistochemistry and fluorescence imaging, as well as smFISH, prepare an A4P0 hydrogel: 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (0% PFA) in 1\u00d7 PBS. For 200 ml of hydrogel monomer solution, add 20 ml of 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide and 20 ml of 10\u00d7 PBS to 160 ml of ice-cold dH2O. Stir 500 mg of thermoinitiator 2,2\u2032-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride into ice-cold monomer solution (0.25% (wt/vol) final concentration). Hydrogel monomer solutions must remain cold before use to prevent premature polymerization; we generally prepare solutions freshly on ice, but they may be stored short-term (several hours) at 4 \u00b0C or on ice, or long-term (several months) at \u221220 \u00b0C, protected from light.\n\nCritical\nWe have tested various hydrogel monomer formulations: including combinations of 2% or 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide with 0% or 4% PFA and/or 0.05\u20130.25% (wt/vol) bis-acrylamide. We found that A4P0 without bis-acrylamide granted rapid clearing and good antibody penetration during immunohistochemistry (IHC) without compromising the macromolecular content and cellular structure of tissue samples. In comparison with CLARITY, we eliminated 4% PFA from the hydrogel monomer solution; however, we ensure the thorough PFA-mediated cross-linking of tissue proteins before hydrogel monomer incubation via 4% PFA transcardial perfusion and 4% PFA postfixation steps.\n\n\nCritical\nTo enlarge the hydrogel pores for faster sample clearing and immunolabeling, we excluded bis-acrylamide and PFA from the hydrogel recipe proposed for CLARITY8. Although tissue proteins and overall tissue architecture was preserved during PACT and PARS processing18, specific native and non-native biomolecules (e.g., non-membrane-associated proteins, cytoplasmic signaling molecules, commensal and pathogenic microorganisms) may be more sensitive to the clearing process. Herein, either or both of these hydrogel components may be re-introduced into the hydrogel formulation to increase cross-linking density and thus better stabilize sparse epitopes. However, any increase in the net concentrations of hydrogel monomers will result in slower diffusion of SDS micelles and of antibody-based labels during clearing and immunostaining, respectively.\n\n\n\nA4P1, A4P2 and A4P4 monomer solutions\n\nTo preserve a sensitive sample's structural integrity during clearing, include 1, 2, or 4% PFA (wt/vol, final concentration) in the hydrogel formulations (i.e., A4P1, A4P2, and A4P4, respectively). For example, for 200 ml of A4P4 monomer solution, add 20 ml of 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide, 25 ml of 32% (wt/vol) PFA and 20 ml of 10\u00d7 PBS to 135 ml of ice-cold dH2O. Stir 500 mg of thermoinitiator 2,2\u2032-azobis[2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride into ice-cold monomer solution (0.25% (wt/vol) final concentration). Hydrogel monomer solutions must remain cold before use to prevent premature polymerization; we generally prepare solutions freshly on ice, but they may be stored short-term at 4 \u00b0C or long-term at \u221220 \u00b0C, protected from light.\n\n\nPACT-deCAL\n\nCombine 10 ml of 0.5 M EDTA and 40 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS; adjust the pH to 8 and store it at RT for up to a year, barring contamination.\n\n\nDetergent for tissue clearing\n\nPACT and PARS tissue clearing is accomplished via exposing the tissue to an 8% (wt/vol) SDS detergent solution or, in special cases (PACT-deCAL, ePACT), to a 10% (wt/vol) SDS detergent solution. All initial validation of PACT and PARS was performed using a range of SDS concentrations (4\u201316% (wt/vol) SDS), prepared in a range of buffers (1\u00d7 PBS at pH 7.5, 1\u00d7 PBS at pH 8.0 (for PACT-deCAL), 1\u00d7 PBS at pH 8.5 and in 0.2 M sodium borate buffer at pH 8.5). Aside from a slight clearing rate enhancement at more alkaline pH (i.e., 8% SDS-BB and 8% SDS-PBS at pH 8.5), there was no apparent trade-off in the quality or characteristics of cleared soft tissue. Thus, PARS and PACT tissue clearing in 1\u00d7 PBS at pH 7.5 (abbreviated 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5)) may hold added convenience for many users. We suggest periodically replacing the clearing solution if it begins to acidify (i.e., monitor the clearing solution pH with pH indicator strips every 72 h). For PACT-deCAL, we strongly recommend increasing the SDS concentration and clearing solution pH, as both will favor more rigorous and efficient calcium removal; the results presented in Figure 6 were obtained using a clearing solution of 10% (wt/vol) SDS in 1\u00d7 PBS, with a final pH of 8.0 (abbreviated 10% SDS-PBS (pH 8)).\n\nCritical\nIt is worthwhile to note that sodium borate buffer possesses antimicrobial and antifungal characteristics that make it an ideal buffer for extended tissue incubations. When 1\u00d7 PBS instead of sodium borate is used, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be added to the buffer (e.g., a final concentration of 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide in buffer solutions). We prepare clearing solutions fresh for each round of tissue clearing, with RT storage (up to several weeks) of excess clearing solution for buffer exchanges.\n\n\nCritical\nAlthough a clearing solution of 8% (wt/vol) SDS is proposed, users may wish to vary the SDS concentration according to their needs. As a starting point, lower SDS concentrations should be used for larger samples, as this prevents the detergent-exposed outer layers from overclearing while the sample center remains opaque. Thinner tissue sections (e.g., 250-\u03bcm brain slices from electrophysiology) may be cleared rapidly with 10\u201315% (wt/vol) SDS; however, overclearing and loss of biomolecules are a greater risk.\n\n\n\nAntibody incubation buffer (IHC buffer)\n\nThe dilution of antibodies used in PACT and PARS will be highly dependent on, among other things, the quality of the antibody, the size and tissue type of the sample to be labeled, and the cellular location and concentration (i.e., expression level) of the target biomolecule. We recommend a starting dilution of \u223c1:200\u2013400 and/or staining reagents in 1\u00d7 PBS containing 2% (vol/vol) normal donkey serum, 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide; however, the exact antibody concentrations will need to be validated on a case-by-case basis. Freshly prepare IHC buffer.\n\n\nRIMS\n\nFor a mounting medium with an RI = 1.47 (RIMS-1.47), which is used for all samples presented here unless otherwise noted, dissolve 40 g of Histodenz in 30 ml of sterile-filtered 0.02 M phosphate buffer. This is most easily accomplished by adding Histodenz, phosphate buffer and a magnetic stir bar to the final storage container (e.g., a 125-ml glass jar with a lid); sealing the container to minimize evaporation and contamination; and stirring the solution on a stir plate for \u223c10 min, vigorously shaking the closed jar by hand a few times during the stirring process. Once the Histodenz has dissolved, add sodium azide to a total concentration of 0.01% (wt/vol) and adjust the pH to 7.5 with NaOH. RIMS may be prepared with a lower or higher RI by varying the final concentration (wt/vol) of dissolved Histodenz (Fig. 6b). RIMS may be stored at RT for several months; discard it if microbial contamination occurs. Do not autoclave any solutions containing sodium azide.\n\nCritical\nThere are numerous commercial and home-made RIMS alternatives, including FocusClear24, Cargille Labs optical liquids15, 2,2\u2032-thiodiethanol44 and diluted glycerol. We have only verified the compatibility of FocusClear and glycerol with our PACT and PARS prepared samples, and thus we provide a glycerol-based mounting medium recipe here.\n\n\n\nsRIMS\n\nPrepare a 70% (wt/vol) sorbitol solution in 0.02 M phosphate buffer with 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide (pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH); store sRIMS at RT for up to several months, barring microbial contamination. This sorbitol-based mounting medium outperforms 80\u201390% (vol/vol) glycerol as RIMS for rodent brain samples. At a net cost of \u223c$0.2 per ml, sRIMS offers the greatest cost advantage over commercial RI matching solutions that we have tested, such as FocusClear8, and without a sacrifice in performance.\n\n\ncRIMS\n\nPrepare a stock buffer solution of sterile-filtered 0.005 M phosphate buffer. For a mounting medium with RI = 1.47, dissolve 40 g of Histodenz in 30 ml of this stock buffer solution; this is most easily accomplished on a stir plate (see instructions for RIMS). Once the Histodenz has dissolved, add sodium azide to 0.01% (wt/vol) and adjust the pH to 7.5 with NaOH. cRIMS may be stored at 4 \u00b0C for several months, barring microbial contamination. Samples that require short-term storage at 4 \u00b0C may be mounted in cRIMS, whereas RIMS-mounted tissue will become cloudy or turbid placed at 4 \u00b0C\u2014the lower salt concentration of cRIMS reduces the appearance of salt precipitate at colder temperatures. Do not autoclave any solutions that contain sodium azide.\n\n\nEQUIPMENT SETUP\nDegassing the container for hydrogel polymerization\n\nGlass Vacutainers work well for degassing and hydrogel-embedding small rodent organs and tissue samples. However, for rat whole brains and larger tissue samples, a larger container is sometimes useful. One solution is to purchase rubber stoppers that are compatible with 50-ml conical tubes and replace the conical screw-cap with an air-tight rubber stopper during degassing and hydrogel polymerization steps (Fig. 2).\n\n\nPARS chamber\n\nTo perfuse PARS reagents through vasculature in a contained environment, we construct a PARS chamber using components that are readily found in most of the biological research laboratories (Fig. 7). The necessary components of a PARS setup are as follows: a feeding needle catheter to deliver PARS reagents to vasculature; a perfusate catch-basin (pipette box) in which recirculating PARS reagents may pool once they exit the vasculature;-Tygon tubing threaded through a peristaltic pump so that pooling reagents may be collected from the catch-basin and recirculated back into a subject's vasculature; Luer-to-tubing couplers; and a Ziploc bag to contain the entire PARS chamber setup.\nTo construct the PARS chamber, drill two 1/8-inch holes into the front and one 1/8-inch hole into the left side wall of an empty 1,000-\u03bcl pipette tip box. The holes are drilled just below the tip wafer (in Fig. 7, the holes are \u223c2 cm below the top rim). Next, snap 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connectors into each of the drilled holes. The outflow line will circulate solvents from the pipette box chamber to the 3-way stopcock. To join the outflow line to a 3-way stopcock, use a 10-cm piece of Tygon tubing and connect one end to the inner left side 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connector and tape the other end to the inside bottom of the pipette tip box. Continue this line through a peristaltic pump by using a new piece of Tygon tubing, and connect one end to the outer left side 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connector and then thread the tubing through a peristaltic pump. Next, join the free end to a three-way stopcock with a 3/32-inch barbed male Luer with locking nut. The inflow line circulates solvents from the three-way stopcock to the vasculature. To link the inflow line to the pipette tip box, use a piece of 15-cm Tygon tubing and connect one end to the outer right front 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connector and the other end to the three-way stopcock with a 3/32-inch barbed male Luer with locking nut. To finish the inflow line, connect a piece of 75-cm Tygon tubing to the inner right front 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connector. Next, coil the inflow line to the bottom of the pipette tip box. This will equilibrate inflowing solvent to the desired temperature before it enters the subject's vasculature. Tape the coiled tubing to the pipette tip box. To quickly circulate bubbles formed during the changing of solutions without disconnecting the inflow line and for use of bubbling nitrogen gas into the solution during the polymerization step, a line linking the outflow line back to the pipette tip box is connected by joining a piece of 15-cm Tygon tubing to the three-way stopcock with a full-thread 3/32-inch barbed female Luer to the outer left front 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connector. This line is continued inside the pipette tip box and taped to the bottom. To finish the chamber, thread the inflow line through the top-left corner of the tip wafer and connect it to a feeding tube with a 1/8-inch barbed male slip Luer. As a forewarning, SDS and salt precipitate will begin to accumulate within these narrow lines over time. It is important to flush the lines (e.g., with ddH2O) between subjects, and to replace occluded lines with new Tygon tubing (e.g., after every few subjects).\nDuring hydrogel polymerization, the chamber must be enclosed inside a Ziploc freezer bag. To do this, disconnect the outer Tygon tubing that connects to the barbed connectors of the pipette tip box, and puncture three holes into the Ziploc bag to accommodate the 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connectors. Reconnect the Tygon tubing to their original 1/8 \u00d7 1/8-inch barbed connector. To connect a vacuum line to this bagged PARS box for withdrawing oxygen, tape a female Luer tee onto the lid of the pipette box and puncture one hole through the Ziploc. Finally, make the Ziploc airtight by placing clay around the punctured regions in the Ziploc.\nAs a final note, a 1,000-\u03bcl tip box has a volume of \u223c750 ml. Thus, during hydrogel polymerization and during clearing, 200\u2013300 ml of solution may be placed in the pipette box for recirculation without risk of the pipette box overflowing or the solution splashing out during its transport. Similarly, to conserve reagents during PARS clearing and immunostaining of smaller samples, a 200-\u03bcl tip box may be used to construct the PARS chamber; only 100 ml of reagent is necessary to fill such a chamber about one-third full (Fig. 7).\n\n\nLight-sheet microscope\n\nThe light-sheet microscope that we use was built based on the laser-scanning single-side illumination method120. Key to the design are objectives that offer a long w.d. while maintaining high NA (e.g., CLARITY objectives with 8 mm w.d. and NA of 1.0). The system described below provides a cost-effective and relatively easy-to-replicate alternative to CLARITY optimized light-sheet microscopy(COLM)15, a recently introduced light-sheet microscope for CLARITY. We used cost-effective optical components, especially when creating, shaping and projecting the illumination light sheet. The immersion chamber and sample holder are custom-made with a 3D printer. The list of components and the .stl design files can be found in the Supplementary Table 1 and in the Supplementary Data 1 and 2 (.stl format), for the immersion chamber and sample holder, respectively.\nThe microscope is built onto a 4 \u00d7 6-foot optical table (Fig. 9b). The various lasers are combined with dichroic filters to one beam, which is then expanded using a Galilean telescope and shaped with an iris to match the Galvanometer scanner mirror size (6 mm in diameter). The Galvanometer scanner, coupled with an f-theta lens, is then used to generate the scanning light sheet, which is projected to the sample holder using two achromatic doublet lenses. The resulting light sheet has a full-width-half-maximum of 5\u20137 \u03bcm, depending on the wavelength of illumination (473\u2013632 nm).\nThe detection objective lens (25\u00d7, 1.0 NA CLARITY objective, Olympus) is inserted into the immersion chamber. To prevent leakage of the medium from the chamber, we sealed the gap between the chamber and the objective with an O-ring and a flexible latex film, in which only the tip of the detection objective is immersed. This setting allows the objective to move uninterruptedly during data acquisition while maintaining a sealed connection. The immersion chamber is created with a 3D printer (ABS plastic) and it is filled with glycerol to prevent evaporation-induced aberrations in RIMS medium.\nAdjacent to the detection objective, we use tube lenses with different focal lengths to change the magnification of the light-sheet microscope and, consequently, its field of view. Higher magnification is used to digitally sample the acquired images in line with the high NA of the detection lens. We typically use magnification values between 25\u00d7 and 55\u00d7, with the corresponding field of view of 0.28\u20130.06 mm2. To acquire the images, a camera with a light-sheet mode feature is used (Zyla 4.2 sCMOS, Andor), in which the scanning light sheet and the camera pixel readout are synchronized to improve the signal-to-noise ratio121.\nTo rapidly scan large volumes, the sample is constantly translated using a xyz-theta stage, whereas the light sheet remains stationary. The xyz-theta stage is mounted on heavy-duty stainless steel bars to prevent sample vibration during data acquisition. To connect the sample holder to the xyz-theta stage, we first place the sample in a quartz cuvette filled with RIMS solution. The cuvette is then attached to a 3D printed cap that has a Luer lock female connector mounted on top, and laboratory Parafilm is used to seal the connector-cuvette interface. The sample holder is then attached to a xyz-theta stage via the Luer lock male connector.\nTo automatically scan large volumes using the microscope, we wrote a MATLAB program, which runs \u03bcManager75 and serial communication, both controlling and synchronizing the various mechanical components. This program finds the synchronization parameters to run the camera in a light-sheet mode, performs autofocus for the detection objective and optimizes the lateral position of the illumination light sheet. To this end, both the illumination lens and the detection objective are mounted on computer-controlled linear stages.\n\n\nComputer for visualization workflow\n\nWe perform visualization workflows for a sample single channel, 8-bit, 30-GB image on a 64-bit Windows 8 machine with Intel i7-3770 CPU and 16 GB of RAM.\n\n\nProcedureTissue preparation for PACT and PARSTiming 2 h\u20131 d\n\n1\nPrepare the perfusion and hydrogel monomer solutions, including 1\u00d7 PBS containing 0.5% (wt/vol) NaNO2 (optional, for vasodilation) and 10 U/ml heparin (optional, for anticoagulation; hPBS), 4% PFA in 1\u00d7 PBS and the A4P0 hydrogel solution.\n\nCritical Step\n4% PFA should be freshly prepared. A4P0 may be freshly prepared or stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. For the latter, thaw A4P0 on ice before use. Perfusion solutions should be ice-cold. Discard PFA and hydrogel stock solutions if a precipitate is observed.\n\n\n\n2\nAnesthetize the animal with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Euthasol (100 mg/kg of body mass for mice and rats), or according to institutional guidelines for rodent euthanasia (e.g., carbon dioxide inhalation until loss of consciousness, injection of pentobarbital or similar).\n\nCaution\nFollow appropriate institutional and governmental guidelines and regulations for husbandry, handling and euthanasia of laboratory animals.\n\n\n\n3\nTranscardially perfuse122 the subject with ice-cold hPBS until the perfusate drains clear from the right atrium (\u223c20 ml at 10 ml/min for mice, \u223c100 ml at 50 ml/min for rats).\n\nCritical Step\nThe perfusion pressure (flow rate) during transcardial perfusion and during PARS (unless otherwise noted) should approximate the physiological pressure of the subject's circulatory system; at night, mice and rats have systolic and diastolic pressures (mm Hg) of \u223c125/90 (mouse) and 121/84 (rat), respectively. When using a peristaltic pump123 or alternative pressurized system122, we suggest a rate of 10 ml/min for mice and \u223c100 ml/min for rats given that their cardiac output is reported to be \u223c10\u201335 ml/min (mouse124,125,126) and \u223c50\u2013120 ml/min (rat127), respectively, depending on sex, strain, age and so on124,125,126,127. If the perfusate is observed to leak out of the subject's nostrils, the cerebral vasculature was probably compromised by too high a flow rate; it is not advisable to proceed with PARS-based clearing of this subject, as PARS reagents may not reach all tissues; instead, organs of interest can be excised and cleared by PACT. Decrease the perfusion flow rate for all subsequent transcardial perfusions and PARS-based clearing steps. For the initial perfusion fixation (Steps 3\u20134), gravity alone may be used to draw hPBS and PFA through rodent vasculature.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n4\nWithout introducing air to the perfusion tubing, continue to perfuse the animal with ice-cold PFA (\u223c50\u201370 ml at 10 ml/min for mice, \u223c100 ml at 50 ml/min for rats).\n\nCritical Step\nAlthough there are several alternative fixatives to 4% PFA, many of them carry consequences that are particularly detrimental to the hydrogel-embedding process and/or subsequent imaging of thick cleared samples. Mechanistically, formaldehyde augments the conjugation of tissue components to the acrylamide scaffold via its formation of methylene bridges between peptide amines and acrylamide, and thus fixatives that lack this cross-linking ability will result in limited tissue-hydrogel hybridization. Although glutaraldehyde, which is commonly used for EM sample preparation, can penetrate and cross-link tissue more efficiently than formaldehyde, it also generates high autofluorescence that is more difficult to counteract in thicker tissues via standard aldehyde blocking measures.\n\n\n\n5\nFor PACT-based clearing of excised tissue samples, including bones (PACT-deCAL variation), prepare tissue as described in option A. For PARS-based whole-body or whole-organ clearing using continuous perfusion through intact vasculature, proceed to option B. PARS-CSF allows within-skull clearing through the use of an indwelling guide cannula, which was either previously inserted for neurobiological or pharmacological studies or positioned specifically for PARS-CSF clearing. For PARS-CSF whole-brain or whole-spinal cord clearing using continuous perfusion through an intracranial cannula, proceed to option C.\n\nA\n\nTissue preparation for PACT\n\n\ni\nCarefully excise whole organs and tissues to be processed with PACT.\n\n\nii\nIf appropriate, slice whole organs into 0.5- to 3.0-mm-thick sections. Alternatively, pliable or fragile organs may be easier to thick-section, if required, immediately after hydrogel-embedding, which greatly increases their firmness, before proceeding to clearing (Step 7).\n\n\niii\nPostfix the samples in 4% PFA for 1\u20132 h at RT with gentle agitation on a rocking platform shaker.\n\nPause point\nThe samples may be postfixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Fixing samples for longer periods of time, especially smaller, thinly sectioned tissues, may result in overfixation and antigen masking.\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nTissue preparation for PARS\n\n\ni\nSet up the PARS chamber, tubing and pump. Prefill the PARS tubing with PFA so that no air bubbles are introduced into vasculature or-tissue. Fill the pipette box with PFA until it is about one-third to one-half full.\n\n\nii\nTransfer the perfused subject to the PARS chamber, laying the subject on top of the pipette wafer.\n\n\niii\nPARS reagents will be delivered through the same feeding needle catheter used during transcardial perfusion. Thus, after transferring the rodent to the PARS chamber, check the placement of the feeding needle catheter. The catheter should enter the left ventricle. If it sits stably in the ventricle, leave it as is. Otherwise, advance the catheter through the left ventricle and into the aorta, just before the level of the aortic arch. Connect the PARS tubing to the feeding needle catheter.\n\nCritical Step\nBe careful not to tear rodent vasculature.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\niv\nSet the peristaltic pump to a flow rate of 1 ml/min and postfix the subject for 1\u20132 h at RT. As 4% PFA is pumped through the feeding needle, PFA perfusate should exit the right atrium and drain into the pipette box. This perfusate is then drawn up through tubing and recirculated through the subject.\n\nCritical Step\nIf necessary, add additional 4% PFA to the pipette box so that there is always enough PFA pooled in the pipette box to be recirculated through the tubing and subject vasculature. The amount of solution required for continuous recirculation will depend on the individual setup (size of the pipette box, liquid volume to fill tubing, evaporation from PARS chamber, species of subject and so on).\n\n\n\nv\nTo prevent PFA from cross-linking acrylamide within vasculature during subsequent steps, perfuse 1\u00d7 PBS for 45 min at RT.\n\n\n\n\nC\n\nTissue preparation for PARS-CSF\n\n\ni\nIf an indwelling guide cannula is not available, insert an intracranial brain shunt (e.g., 20-G blunt needle) into the cisterna magna for spinal cord clearing, or lower the cannula through the skull (by drilling a hole in the area of interest and using tweezers to create an opening in the dura), to the level of the subarachnoid space, directly above the dorsal inferior colliculus18. Ensure that the cannula, whether newly inserted or existing, is firmly attached to the skull using dental acrylic (C&B-Metabond, Parkell), and that it is free from blockages.\n\n\nii\nSet up the PARS chamber, tubing and pump; prefill the PARS tubing with 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide monomer solution (A4P0) so that no air bubbles are introduced into vasculature or tissue. Partially fill the pipette box with cold A4P0.\n\n\niii\nTranscardially perfuse with 4% PFA, and then briefly perfuse the subject with 1\u00d7 PBS (\u226430\u201360 ml for mice and rats, respectively) to wash away excess 4% PFA.\n\n\niv\nFor whole-brain and whole-spinal cord clearing, ligate the arterial circulation, leaving the carotid arteries intact, and for rats or larger subjects remove tissue not directly perfused by these vessels to conserve reagents. Transfer the subject to the PARS chamber, positioning tissue atop the pipette tip wafer. For whole-brain clearing alone, if desired, decapitate the perfused subject and transfer only the head to the PARS chamber.\n\n\nv\nConnect the PARS tubing to the cannula.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Step\nAfter perfusion fixation, all tissue samples that contain endogenous fluorophores must be protected from light. Minimize unnecessary light exposure during long incubations (>1 h) by, for example, wrapping the sample containers in aluminum foil.\n\n\nFormation of a tissue-hydrogel matrixTiming 1 d\nCritical Step\nThe polymerization of tissue components with hydrogel monomers is crucial, as it ensures that SDS micelles preferentially solubilize and remove tissue lipids during clearing. We previously demonstrated that a minimal acrylamide-based network, which supports more rapid clearing, was nevertheless sufficient for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acid18. To increase the level of cross-linking without the addition of bis-acrylamide or PFA to the hydrogel monomer solution, the hydrogel-infused tissue should be carried through a rigorous degassing step.\n\n\n\n6\nInfuse the sample with A4P0 via passive diffusion for PACT-based clearing (option A), or via continuous perfusion of A4P0 and then thermoinitiator for PARS and PARS-CSF (option B).\n\nA\n\nHydrogel-embedding of PACT samples\n\n\n\ni\nTransfer the PFA-fixed samples into a Vacutainer or conical tube with a rubber stopper. Fill the container with ice-cold A4P0 hydrogel solution until the samples are fully submerged. Incubate the samples at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\n\nCritical Step\nOnce it is placed in monomer solution, the sample must remain at 2\u20138 \u00b0C. Warmer temperatures may cause premature polymerization of hydrogel monomers before they have uniformly diffused throughout the tissue sample.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nPause point\nSamples may be incubated in A4P0 at 4 \u00b0C for 3 d.\n\n\n\nii\nPurge the samples and sample container of residual oxygen. Insert one 4-inch-long hypodermic needle into the stopper so that the needle reaches near the bottom of the container, fully submerged in the hydrogel solution. Insert a second 1-inch-long needle into the stopper\u2014this needle should not touch the hydrogel solution; its sole purpose is to vent excess gas from the container to avoid pressure buildup.\n\n\niii\nConnect the hypodermic needle to the nitrogen gas source (Fig. 2b) and slowly turn on the flow of nitrogen. Allow the nitrogen gas to bubble through the hydrogel monomer solution for 1\u201310 min before turning off the flow of nitrogen, and then remove both needles.\n\nCritical Step\nTo form a more rigid tissue-hydrogel matrix, which imparts superior tissue cross-linking and only minor slowing of clearing and immunostaining steps, perform a more rigorous gas-exchange step. Place the sample container on ice and insert a 1-inch-long needle into the stopper. Connect the 1-inch-long needle to the house vacuum line and degas the sample for 5\u201310 min, depending on the sample size and volume of hydrogel. Gently tap or briefly vortex the sample container every minute to dislodge air bubbles from the tissue. Unhook the needle from the vacuum line, leaving the needle inserted in the stopper so that it may serve as a venting needle during nitrogen exchange. Remove the sample-container from ice, insert a 4-inch-long hypodermic needle that is connected to the nitrogen line into the stopper and bubble nitrogen gas into the hydrogel monomer solution for 5\u201310 min. Turn off the flow of nitrogen. For larger tissue samples, such as whole rat organs, repeat the degassing process (degassing the sample on ice, and then bubbling nitrogen through the hydrogel solution). When this step is completed, remove both needles and proceed to Step 6A(iv).\n\n\n\niv\nPlace the sample container in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for 2\u20133 h.\n\nCritical Step\nWith rigorous degassing, the A4P0 solution will form a hydrogel having the consistency of honey or tacky silicone sealant, which is difficult to remove from the tissue. With a 1-min nitrogen gas exchange, the A4P0 solution will form a hydrogel with the consistency of syrup, which may be poured off easily.\n\n\n\nv\nRemove the excess hydrogel from the tissue sample. Exercise caution when you are removing tacky hydrogel from the tissue: cut away excess hydrogel with a scalpel or small surgical scissors and then use a Kimwipe to carefully remove excess hydrogel from the tissue. Briefly rinse the samples in 1\u00d7 PBS to wash away residual, syrupy-like, hydrogel from minimally degassed samples.\n\nCaution\nHydrogel waste disposal should be conducted according to federal, state and local regulations.\n\n\n\nvi\nHydrogel-embedded samples will have increased rigidity and structural integrity, and indeed this may be the primary goal for some users. In this case, it is possible to transfer hydrogel-embedded soft tissues (e.g., pancreas, spleen, thymus) and amorphous biological samples (e.g., sputum, mucus, organoid cell masses) that were prepared in Steps 1\u20136 to other lines of experimental evaluation without proceeding with the PACT clearing protocol. All other users should proceed directly to Step 7 for instructions on how to chemically clear PACT samples.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nHydrogel-embedding of PARS samples\n\n\ni\nCirculate 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (A4P0) in 1\u00d7 PBS through PARS tubing at RT overnight. Ensure that there is enough A4P0 pooled in the pipette tip box such that the tubing will not run dry during continuous recirculation.\n\n\nii\nBriefly perfuse the sample with 1\u00d7 PBS to remove A4P0 and any residual PFA from the vasculature.\n\nCritical Step\nUse only enough 1\u00d7 PBS to flush the vasculature of A4P0 (e.g., <5 ml for a mouse; 10 ml for a rat); do not infuse 1\u00d7 PBS for so long that it displaces the A4P0 from tissue.\n\n\n\niii\nWithout disconnecting the perfusion lines, place the PARS chamber into a Ziploc bag and place the bag under nitrogen atmosphere (i.e., fill the bag with nitrogen gas, deflate the bag, refill it with nitrogen gas, seal the bag closed around the perfusion and set it aside for a few minutes while performing Step 6B(iv)).\n\n\niv\nPrepare 200 ml of 0.25% (wt/vol, final concentration) VA-044 initiator in 1\u00d7 PBS; degas this solution via bubbling nitrogen gas through the solution for \u223c10 min. Add this solution to the pipette box within the Ziploc bag, and place the bag-encased pipette box into a 37\u201342 \u00b0C water bath. If necessary, place a lead weight on top of the perfusion chamber to prevent it from tipping over. Turn on the pump so that the initiator circulates through the sample and PARS tubing, and allow the sample to incubate for 2\u20133 h in the water bath, replacing the solution with freshly 'nitrogen-degassed' solution every hour. Alternatively, if the setup permits, the nitrogen gas can be bubbled directly into the 200 ml of 0.25% VA-044 initiator in 1\u00d7 PBS that is already loaded into the pipette box while slowly degassing the chamber, as shown in Figure 7i. This requires disassembly of the PARS chamber to make an airtight environment with the Ziploc bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTissue delipidation with SDSTiming 12 h\u20133 weeks\nCritical Step\nThe rate of tissue clearing depends on several parameters, including the inherent structural and biochemical properties of the tissue sample, the volume of the tissue sample, the hydrogel pore size and the density of tissue-hydrogel cross-linking, as well as the clearing setup (SDS concentration, incubation temperature and pH of clearing buffer). It is important for users to determine the clearing parameters for their specific tissue samples empirically, using these guidelines as a starting point for further optimization. Similarly, because the rate of clearing may vary greatly, tissues embedded in minimal hydrogel monomer compositions, such as the A4P0 hydrogel suggested here, are more susceptible to deteriorating when samples are left unattended in SDS.\n\n\n\n7\nClear the tissue samples at 37\u201342 \u00b0C using either gentle agitation (PACT, option A; or PACT-deCAL, option B) or perfusion (PARS, option C); the latter accelerates micelle diffusion for rapid whole-body clearing. Although 8% (wt/vol) SDS is sufficient to solubilize lipids in soft tissue, 10% (wt/vol) SDS and EDTA are required to clear and decalcify bone (PACT-deCAL, option B). The PACT clearing procedure (option A) may be paused for 1\u20132 d by transferring the sample to PBS or diluted SDS (37\u201342 \u00b0C water bath, or at RT), and then returning the sample to SDS to resume clearing. Although a primary benefit of PARS clearing (option C) is its efficiency, if it is necessary to delay the PARS procedure, whole organs of rodents may be cleared via PARS and then stored for up to 1 month in PBS or in diluted SDS. However, if it becomes necessary to abort PARS (option C) because of unforeseen technical difficulties (examples of such issues that we have encountered include antibodies being out of stock at the manufacturer, an out-of-order microscope, compromised vasculature or leaky pump lines and a damaged PARS pump head), partially cleared samples can be excised and transferred into diluted SDS for up to a month for storage or 8\u201310% (wt/vol) SDS to finish clearing via PACT (Step 7A(i)) or PACT-deCAL (Step 7B(i)). For delays within any of the methods of preparation (PACT, PACT-deCAL and PARS), it can be better for tissue quality to maintain excised cleared tissues in diluted SDS rather than storing samples after clearing/immunostaining in PBS or mountant. The latter case risks hydrogel disintegration, sample contamination and/or fluorescence signal loss.\n\n\nA\n\nPACT clearing\n\n\ni\nPlace each tissue-hydrogel sample into a 50-ml conical tube containing clearing buffer; gently rock the sample in a 37\u201342 \u00b0C shaking water bath until the tissue is optically transparent.\n\n\nii\nIf you are using thin organ slices (<1 mm) embedded in A4P0, check the clearing progress every hour, as they should clear in <12 h. Similarly, porous tissue and samples with a high surface area\u2013to-volume ratio may clear in less than 24 h. It is recommended that new users monitor the increasing transparency of such samples every 1\u20132 h during initial test runs. Once a sample's time to clear is determined empirically by the user, stringent monitoring is no longer necessary. Dense, highly myelinated or thick-sectioned (1\u20134 mm) tissue and whole organs should be checked daily during clearing, and it may require >96 h.\n\nCritical Step\nAvoid overclearing. For certain organs, and for brain tissue in particular, variations in cell density and myelination cause specific regions to clear at different rates. Thus, some regions will become transparent, whereas the slower clearing regions will be only semitranslucent. Continuing to clear samples until all regions are uniformly transparent may lead to hydrogel softening, protein solubilization and/or structural deformity in the rapidly clearing areas. In addition, overclearing is deleterious to endogenous fluorescence. As tissue mounting in RIMS will lend an additional degree of optical transparency to tissues, it is crucial to remove tissues from SDS when the majority of tissue, or the portion of interest, is transparent, even if some regions appear undercleared. This will help ensure that the tissue macromolecular content is preserved. Alternatively, as opposed to terminating the incubation of tissue in 8% (wt/vol) SDS prematurely, one may lower the percentage of SDS (e.g., from 8% to 4% (wt/vol) SDS) in clearing buffer at the final stages of clearing.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\niii\nOnce the appropriate region of tissue appears optically transparent, wash the tissue extensively at RT with gentle shaking. For rapid tissue processing, conduct a minimal wash step of 4\u20135 buffer exchanges in 1\u00d7 PBS over a 12- to 24-h period. Herein, residual SDS may precipitate, causing tissue cloudiness. To achieve more thorough removal of SDS, or to wash larger tissue blocks, wash the samples in either BBT or PBST for 1\u20132 d, with 4\u20135 buffer exchanges over the course of washing.\n\nCritical Step\nIt is almost always preferable to perform wash steps of cleared samples at RT. We have found that additional 37 \u00b0C incubations of cleared tissue or, in particular, alternating between RT and 37 \u00b0C incubations are hazardous to tissue structural integrity, as cleared tissue lacks the structural support previously offered by lipids and thus must be handled with care. However, a single 37 \u00b0C sample wash after clearing and/or a final 37 \u00b0C sample wash that precedes sample mounting (Step 10) may be beneficial to accelerating the diffusion of residual SDS from tissue and/or removing SDS precipitate, respectively.\n\n\nPause point\nCleared and washed samples can be stored in 1\u00d7 PBS (or PBST) containing 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide at RT for 1\u20132 d. Tissues may become cloudy from salt precipitate, in which case wash them with a few changes of PB.\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nPACT-deCAL\n\n\ni\n\nCritical Step\nThe following steps have been optimized for clearing the dissected tibia of an adult mouse. For other bone types, it is important to adjust the parameters of PACT-deCAL, such as the duration of bone incubations in clearing and decalcifying buffers, and the concentration of EDTA. Temperature fluctuations (e.g., from performing SDS or EDTA buffer changes with RT solutions rather than with prewarmed 37 \u00b0C solutions, or from a water bath that is unable to maintain a constant 37 \u00b0C environment) may adversely affect bone tissue morphology128.\n\n\n\nii\nPlace each bone-hydrogel sample into a 50-ml conical tube containing 10% SDS-PBS (pH 8.0) clearing buffer; gently rock the sample in a 37 \u00b0C shaking water bath for 2 d.\n\n\niii\nTransfer the sample into 0.1 M EDTA in 1\u00d7 PBS, pH 8.0, and incubate it for \u22652 d in the 37 \u00b0C shaking water bath.\n\nCritical Step\nBone becomes soft and flexible when decalcified. Larger samples may require up to 6 d and up to 0.5 M EDTA to decalcify.\n\n\n\niv\nReplace the EDTA-PBS with fresh 10% SDS-PBS (pH 8.0), and continue to clear the sample in a 37 \u00b0C shaking water bath for 2 d.\n\n\nv\nWash the sample in an excess volume of 1\u00d7 PBS (pH 7.4) for 24 h, by performing three or four buffer exchanges.\nTroubleshooting\n\nPause point\nCleared and washed samples may be stored in 1\u00d7 PBS containing 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide at RT for 1\u20132 d.\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\nPARS clearing\n\n\ni\nAfter polymerization, wash the perfusion lines with 1\u00d7 PBS, and then replace the wash buffer with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5) clearing buffer. This procedure can be accomplished easily by removing the PARS chamber from the shaking water bath (optional), by turning off the pump, by removing excess initiator buffer from the PARS chamber and by replacing it with 100 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS to perform the wash. Circulate the wash buffer through the sample for 10 min. Afterward, replace the buffer with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5). Place the chamber back into the Ziploc bag and into the 37\u201342 \u00b0C water bath. Allow the SDS clearing buffer to recirculate through the system for 24 h. Perform a buffer exchange with fresh 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5), by clearing the buffer daily until the recirculated fluid is no longer yellowish, after which the SDS solution can be refreshed less frequently (every 48\u201372 h).\n\nPause point\nWhole organs are rapidly cleared in situ using PARS. However, if the user requires a time delay between clearing and immunostaining steps or must discontinue the PARS procedure, hydrogel-perfused whole organs may be excised after hydrogel polymerization (Step 6B) or after the initiation of PARS clearing (Step 7C(i)), and then stored in 4\u20138% (wt/vol) SDS at 37 \u00b0C for up to 1 month. This allows whole organs to clear slowly during storage; their clearing progress must be monitored, albeit infrequently (e.g., weekly), as smaller, porous organs may become completely transparent in <1 month, wherein they should be transferred into 1\u00d7 PBS (or PBST or BBT) containing 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide at RT. Ensure that all storage solutions contain 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide, and when you are ready to resume processing tissue follow the protocol steps for PACT-based clearing and labeling (Step 7A). Although this PACT-based clearing of PARS-prepared whole organs conserves reagents and minimizes the constant oversight required during PARS clearing, it negates the principal benefits of PARS: efficiency and uniform sample preparation.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nii\nCheck on the clearing progress daily. Add additional SDS buffer to the PARS chamber if necessary, as depending on how well the Ziploc bag is sealed around the perfusion tubing, some buffer may evaporate over time.\n\n\niii\nThe sample can be continuously perfused for up to 2 weeks until all desired organs have cleared, even if some organs appear clear within the first 24\u201348 h. Alternatively, if all but one or two organs appear sufficiently transparent after a few days, one may proceed directly to Step 7C(iv) to flush SDS from tissue, and then excise all organs. The one or two semiopaque excised organs are transferred into 8% (wt/vol) SDS to finish clearing via PACT (see Step 7A), whereas the organs that cleared more rapidly are immediately promoted to passive immunostaining (optional) and mounting (Step 10) without further delay.\n\nCritical Step\nAs with PACT clearing, it is possible to overclear PARS samples, wherein protein and other tissue components are solubilized and the stabilizing hydrogel matrix begins to disintegrate. Generally, most of the major organs are cleared within a similar timeline of 24\u201348 h, whereas the whole brain can take 1\u20132 weeks.\n\n\n\niv\nOnce the tissue appears optically transparent, perfuse eight buffer changes of 200 ml of BBT or 1\u00d7 PBS with 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide (pH 7.4) over a 2-d period in the 37\u201342 \u00b0C water bath.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n8\nFor samples that will be immunolabeled after clearing, the hydrogel matrix will be required to support the cleared tissue for several rounds of washing and multiday incubations with gentle shaking. If the already delicate tissue-hydrogel matrix seems precariously fragile after clearing (this usually only occurs with thin-sectioned tissue), it is advisable to repeat the hydrogel embedding and polymerization steps (Step 5A). This will stabilize tissue architecture during immunolabeling, prevent tissue loss or disintegration and counteract expansion in mounting medium. For cleared samples that will not undergo any immunohistochemical labeling steps before imaging, skip Steps 8 and 9, and proceed directly to Step 10.\n\n\nSingle-cell phenotyping of cleared tissuesTiming 12 h\u20132 weeks\nCritical Step\nPACT and PARS prepared tissues are amenable to most standard immunohistochemical protocols; a list of validated small-molecule dyes, primary antibodies and secondary fluorescent labels is provided in Table 4.\n\nCritical Step\nThis PARS-histology protocol is sufficient to label molecular targets in the peripheral organs of mice and rats, with antibody amounts adjusted for body size. Individual users may need to adjust the incubation times and/or lengthen wash steps.\n\n\n\n9\nPrepare the primary antibody cocktail in IHC buffer. An antibody dilution of 1:200\u2013400 is recommended; however, a more or less concentrated antibody dilution may be required, depending on the tissue identity and bimolecular target. Perform passive labeling (option A) or perfusion-assisted labeling (option B). For passive labeling schemes (option A), thick-sectioned tissues should be incubated in enough of the antibody cocktail to fully bathe all surfaces, usually a few milliliters of antibody cocktail or less, if the tissue is placed in a minimally sized container. For example, 1.5- to 5-ml Eppendorf tubes are recommended. For perfusion-assisted labeling using the PARS setup (option B), \u223c20\u2013100 ml of primary antibody cocktail or labeling solution is required, depending on the tissue volume to be perfused and the total volume of the perfusion system (PARS tubing volume plus an additional amount of solution to partially fill the perfusion chamber).\n\n\nA\n\nPassive histology\n\n\ni\nIncubate the tissues in the primary antibody cocktail at RT with shaking for 3\u20137 d. For small-molecule stains or fluorescent dyes, a 1- to 3-d incubation is usually sufficient, and thin tissue sections (<0.5 mm) may be stained within a few hours.\n\nCritical Step\nThe duration of primary antibody incubation must be determined on a case-specific basis (see antibody penetration guidelines, Fig. 4d). It is highly recommended to use smaller antibody formats for thick-tissue staining, when available129. For A4P0-embedded rodent brain tissue, a full IgG will penetrate \u223c500 \u03bcm over a 3-d incubation at RT with shaking. This length of time is often sufficient for 1 mm tissue slices if the tissue can be imaged from either side. For A4P4-embedded rodent brain tissue, a full IgG will penetrate \u223c200 \u03bcm over a 3-d incubation at RT with shaking.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nii\nTo remove unbound antibody or stain, wash the samples in an excess volume of 1\u00d7 PBS buffer: transfer the samples to a larger container (e.g., a 15- to 50-ml conical tube) and perform four or five 1\u00d7 PBS buffer exchanges over the course of 1 d. Larger tissue blocks, PACT-cleared whole organs, and samples in which high background or nonspecific antibody binding are common should be washed for 2 d in PBST, with four or five buffer exchanges.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\niii\nPrepare the secondary antibody cocktail (1:200\u2013400 recommended dilution) in IHC buffer. Fab fragment secondary antibodies are preferred.\n\n\niv\nIncubate the washed samples in the secondary antibody cocktail for 2\u20135 d at RT and with shaking. Again, samples may be transferred to 1.5- to 5-ml Eppendorf tubes in order to accomplish staining with a minimal volume of antibody.\n\n\nv\nWash labeled samples with four or five buffer exchanges of 1\u00d7 PBS over 1 d.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nPerfusion-assisted labeling\n\n\ni\nReplace the PBST in the perfusion tubing and PARS chamber with the primary antibody cocktail or stain and continuously perfuse the sample for 3 d.\n\n\nii\nExchange the antibody cocktail for 1\u00d7 PBS, and wash the sample by perfusing four buffer changes of 200 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS over the course of 1 d.\n\n\niii\nPrepare the secondary antibody cocktail (1:200\u2013400 recommended dilution) in IHC buffer. Again, Fab secondary antibodies are preferred.\n\n\niv\nReplace the 1\u00d7 PBS in the perfusion tubing and PARS chamber with the secondary antibody cocktail (or stain), and continuously perfuse the sample for 3 d.\n\n\nv\nExchange the antibody cocktail for 1\u00d7 PBS, and wash the sample by perfusing four buffer changes of 200 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS over the course of 1 d.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nRIMS for PACT and PARS samplesTiming 1 d\n\n10\nCalculate the RI of the tissue to be mounted and imaged. Use a refractometer to measure the sample RI according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n11\nPrepare a sample-optimized RIMS formulation by adjusting the amount of Histodenz dissolved in 0.02 M phosphate buffer (for common RI recipes see Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 1b). For most tissues, a RIMS formulation with RI \u223c1.46\u20131.47 is optimal. For bone, prepare a graded series of RIMS formulations: RIMS with RI \u223c1.42, RIMS with RI \u223c1.46 and RIMS with RI \u223c1.48\u20131.49. For imaging thick tissue using immersion objectives corrected for immersion medium with an RI between 1.38 and 1.42, it is sometimes beneficial to match the RI of the RIMS to that of the immersion medium. For example, when using the LD-Plan Apochromat 20\u00d7 1.0 NA Scale objective (Zeiss), RIMS with RI \u223c1.42 will help reduce image distortion in the z-direction.\n\nCritical Step\nAs discussed in the Experimental design section, different mounting solutions can be substituted for RIMS.\n\n\n\n12\nSubmerge the sample in excess RIMS (i.e., in a capped 15- or 50-ml conical tube, or in a 5-ml Eppendorf tube, filled three-fourths full with RIMS) and incubate it at RT until it reaches the desired transparency. Although thin tissue sections may become transparent in less than a single day, a whole rat brain requires a 1-week incubation in RIMS to achieve thorough RI homogenization throughout the sample. These incubation times may be shortened substantially by placing samples on a nutating mixer. Bone should be carried through a graded series of RIMS formulations, each with a progressively higher RI. For example, incubate cleared bone in RIMS-1.42, then in RIMS-1.46, and lastly in RIMS-1.48-1.49 for 1 day each before mounting. Similarly, perform a graded series of RIMS incubations for very fragile tissues, as this will prevent the unlikely event of tissue damage from rapid shrinking and swelling.\n\nCritical Step\nUpon RIMS immersion, cleared tissue will shrink over the course of a few hours (e.g., A4P0-embedded coronal mouse brain sections shrink \u223c20%, size fluctuations are reduced in samples embedded in PFA-containing hydrogels). Continued incubation in RIMS will lead to gradual tissue expansion back to its starting size as RIMS penetrates the tissue. These size changes may confound the visualization of (sub)cellular morphology or introduce apparent tissue deformities. Thus, imaging should not be undertaken before the sample has equilibrated in RIMS. However, if the goal is coarse cellular phenotyping and/or rapid tissue visualization, a much shorter RIMS incubation may be performed (1\u20134 h, or until the sample is sufficiently transparent).\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nPause point\nSamples may be stored for the long term (\u223c3 months) in RIMS. Herein, RIMS-submerged samples should be kept in an airtight container at RT and protected from light. Alternatively, when short-term sample storage at 4 \u00b0C is mandatory, samples may be mounted in cRIMS; store it in a dry, airtight container.\n\n\n\n13\nTransfer the RI-homogenized tissue into an airtight container (e.g., Vacutainers or conical tubes with rubber stoppers) and fill the container with fresh RIMS (or with an alternative mounting medium such as sRIMS or 87% (vol/vol) glycerol) until it just covers the sample. Insert a 1-inch-long needle into the rubber stopper, connect the needle to the house vacuum line, and degas the sample for 5\u201310 min. When you are ready to image, proceed to the next step for mounting instructions.\n\nCritical Step\nAlthough RIMS outperforms sRIMS in our hands, the primary ingredient of sRIMS\u2014sorbitol\u2014not only offers a cost advantage over Histodenz but also is commonly available in research laboratories, owing to its broad use as a cell culture reagent. Importantly, sRIMS grants superior imaging resolution over glycerol.\n\n\nCritical Step\nFor fine-scale analysis (e.g., of subcellular morphology) or lengthy image acquisition, do not image samples immediately after their placement in RIMS. Wait until their initial expansion after RIMS-mounting has plateaued (e.g., several days after mounting 1-mm slices).\n\n\nCritical Step\nIt is crucial that RIMS or other mounting media be prepared with 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide to prevent microbial growth in mounted tissue. Limit the number of air bubbles in sealed slides.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nAcquisitionTiming 1 h to several days\n\n14\nMount and image tissues with a confocal microscope (option A) or with a light-sheet fluorescence microscope (option B).\n\nA\n\nConfocal imaging\n\n\ni\nPrepare glass slides with appropriately sized tissue wells, such as 0.5- to 1.0-mm thick iSpacers, which may be stacked to create deeper wells, or silicone sheets, which may be cut to size. If the silicone spacer is adhesive free, apply vacuum grease to the edge of the spacer. Place samples inside the spacer. Slightly overfill the spacer with RIMS and place a coverslip on top of the spacer. Gently press down to seal the coverslip. Remove overflow RIMS with a Kimwipe.\n\n\nii\nPlace RI-homogenized, thick-sectioned tissues and small whole organs on a glass slide: place the tissue inside the sample well; overfill the well with fresh, degassed RIMS of an appropriate RI such that it forms a convex meniscus. Take care not to introduce bubbles into RIMS, or between the tissue and slide.\n\n\niii\nPlace a cover glass over the sample well, using vacuum grease or nail polish to seal the cover glass onto the well edges. Again, avoid sealing bubbles into the sample well; if this occurs, remove the cover glass and repeat this step, adding more RIMS to the well as necessary.\n\n\niv\nTo image PACT- and PARS-cleared samples with a standard microscopy setup (e.g., a single-photon confocal microscope), use a multi-immersion objective with a RI correction collar to match the RI of the mounted sample: RI \u223c1.46\u20131.47 for most tissues, or \u223c1.48\u20131.49 for bone. For immersion medium, use glycerol with the same RI as the mounting RIMS.\n\n\nv\nDetermine optimum acquisition parameters, and apply these. Acquisition parameters (e.g., photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain, laser power and scanning speed) need to be optimized for each sample on the basis of-the desired final image quality.\n\nCritical Step\nTo allow for accurate stitching, acquisition software should be set to acquire tiles with overlap (>10%). If the microscope has the option, it is useful to use the auto Z brightness correction (Fig. 4b). In Zen (Zeiss), Auto Z provides an automatic gradual adjustment of the detector gain, amplifier offset, amplifier gain and laser intensity setting between the first and last optical slice of a z-stack. This will help ensure that signal intensity is uniform throughout the sample, as even clear tissue will scatter at depth.\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nLight-sheet microscopy\n\n\ni\nMix the glycerol in the immersion chamber using a pipette tip (Fig. 9) to prevent optical aberrations because of inhomogeneous medium, and let the glycerol settle for \u223c1 h.\n\n\nii\nStabilize the sample in a quartz cuvette by submerging the sample in RIMS within the cuvette and by arranging gel pieces around the sample. We use 1% (wt/vol) low-melt agarose gel.\n\n\niii\nPosition the cuvette on the custom sample holder, which may be 3D printed (Supplementary Data 2), and attach it to the sample translation stage, as in Figure 9b.\n\nCritical Step\nMake sure that the cuvette is properly sealed (e.g., with Parafilm; see Fig. 9b), as evaporation of water from RIMS will cause severe aberrations.\n\n\n\niv\nBefore lowering the sample in the immersion chamber, verify that the light sheet is centered in the field of view and that the objective lens is in focus.\n\n\nv\nLower the sample into the immersion chamber.\n\n\nvi\nRe-adjust the light-sheet position to the center of the field of view and re-focus the objective lens.\n\n\nvii\nChange the settings of the camera to a light-sheet mode, activate the driving voltage of the galvo scanner via the function generator and trigger the camera using the external trigger. The delay between the galvo scanner and the camera's external trigger signal should be fine-tuned in order to achieve optimal synchronization; here we used a custom MATLAB program to automatically find the optimum delay; the software is available upon demand.\n\n\nviii\nSet the image acquisition parameters (e.g., laser power, scan depth and the scan resolution in z) and initiate the acquisition sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n3D image visualizationTiming 1 h\nCritical Step\nWe outline workflows for tracing and visualization using tools summarized in Table 3. Interactive processing and visualization software will perform best on a workstation with substantial RAM (>16 GB) and GPU memory (\u22651 GB). The tools mentioned are multi-threaded, and they can often exploit multicore processors to further speed up computations.\n\n\n\n15\nFor the volumetric visualization of large images that do not fit in RAM, select one of the following workflows: (option A) using Imaris (Bitplane); (option B) using TeraStitcher and Vaa3D TeraFly; or (option C) using Vaa3D TeraConvert plug-in and Vaa3D TeraFly. Estimated timing is based on tests with a 30-GB image stack visualized on a 64-bit Windows 8 machine with Intel i7-3770 CPU and 16 GB of RAM.\n\nA\n\nImaris (v7.7.1)\n\n\ni\nStitch image tiles using the acquisition software.\n\n\nii\nOpen the raw image stack (\u223c12 min).\n\n\niii\nSave the loaded images in Imaris .ims format (\u223c24 min). This is useful to streamline future loading and visualization. Reloading the resulting .ims file thereafter takes a few seconds.\n\n\niv\nVisualize the images using the Imaris volumetric view 'Surpass', and then annotate and perform additional image processing using Imaris XTensions.\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nTeraStitcher and the Vaa3D TeraFly plug-in (v2.921/v0.999)\n\n\ni\nStore individual fields of view as separate .tif stacks in a hierarchical set of subdirectories as used by TeraStitcher using the layout specified in https://github.com/abria/TeraStitcher/wiki/User\u2032s-guide.\n\n\nii\nStitch images using either the TeraStitcher standalone program or the Vaa3D plug-in ('Plug-In\u2192Image_stitching\u2192TeraStitcher\u2192Tera stitcher'). TeraStitcher requires that the user specify the voxel dimensions, tile size and tile overlap used during acquisition.\n\n\niii\nSave the stitched output as a tiled, multiresolution volume.\n\n\niv\nIn Vaa3D, start the TeraFly plug-in ('Plug-In\u2192TeramanagerTera\u2192Fly') and select the directory containing the exported 'multi-res tiled volume'.\n\n\nv\nThe 3D view window will now display the whole image data set and progressively load in higher-resolution subvolumes as the user zooms in to particular parts of the image. Use Vaa3D's color map, annotation and analysis tools on selected subvolumes.\n\n\n\nCritical Step\nStitch the tiles and save a multiresolution volume using TeraStitcher (Step 15B(i\u2013iii), also see ref. 62); visualize the resulting image using the Vaa3D TeraFly plug-in in Step 15B(iv\u2013v).\n\n\n\nC\n\nVaa3D TeraConvert and TeraFly plug-in (v2.921/v0.999)\n\n\ni\nStitch images using the acquisition software. Save individual z-sections as a numbered sequence of files in a single directory using either acquisition software export options or by using the 'BioFormats importer' plug-in in Fiji to load as a 'Virtual Stack' and then using the 'BioFormats exporter' plug-in to save as an OME-TIFF file130,131 (http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/), by selecting the option to save each channel and z-section in a separate file.\n\n\nii\nUse TeraConvert plug-in ('Plug-In\u2192Teramanager\u2192TeraConverter') to convert the stored images into a multiresolution 'tiled volume' by specifying the location of the image series and specifying 'Vaa3D raw tiled format' and an output directory.\n\nCritical Step\nPay attention to 'Estimated RAM usage' in the TeraConvert plug-in window. To reduce the memory needed by TeraConvert, deselect the checkboxes next to the lowest resolution output formats (starting from the one with the smallest x,y,z values) until the 'estimated RAM' is less than the available RAM.\n\n\n\niii\nIn Vaa3D, start the TeraFly plug-in ('Plug-In\u2192Teramanager\u2192TeraFly') and select the directory containing the exported multi-resolution 'tiled volume'.\n\n\niv\nThe 3D view window will now display the whole image data set and progressively load in higher-resolution subvolumes as the user zooms in to particular parts of the image. Use Vaa3D's color map and annotation and analysis tools on selected subvolumes.\n\n\n\nCritical Step\nUse the Vaa3D TeraConvert plug-in to convert an already stitched image to tiled, multi-res format (Step 15C(i\u2013ii)), and then use the Vaa3D TeraFly plug-in to visualize the resulting image by following Step 15C(iii\u2013iv).\n\n\n\n\n\n3D image analysisTiming variable\nCritical Step\nA typical workflow is to first run automated tracing to generate initial estimates of morphology and then to perform more detailed semiautomated editing to refine the tracing. Automated tracing is computationally intensive, so it is essential to restrict processing to small ROIs or cropped-out subvolumes and to manually merge the traces afterward. In addition, it is worth noting that semiautomated and manual editing of traces can be greatly accelerated by taking time to learn keyboard shortcuts for a given software tool rather than clicking on graphical user interface elements such as menus or buttons.\n\n\n\n16\nAutomate the tracing of relevant image elements using either neuTube (option A) or Imaris (option B). Alternatively, one may perform tracing using the Vaa3D-Neuron2 plug-in, which has been reviewed previously62. The sample workflows in options A and B and the times reported here are based on our tracing of the test image (Supplementary Data 3) shown in Figure 10.\n\nA\n\nneuTube (v1.0) \u2022 TIMING 3 min\n\n\ni\nLoad the image into neuTube. For commercial image formats that are not recognized by neuTube, use the Fiji 'BioFormats importer' and 'BioFormats exporter' plug-ins to convert to .tif format.\n\n\nii\nSelect 'View\u21923D View' to visualize a volumetric rendering. Click the 'Transfer Function' under the 'Control and Settings' panel to adjust contrast in the 3D view (i in Fig. 10a and Supplementary Fig. 7a). In a large volume containing many cells, center the cursor on an ROI and right-click and select 'Open Zoom In View' to show only image data for a subregion.\n\n\niii\nLeft-click on a cell body and select 'Trace' to automatically trace a neurite from that point. Successively visit the remaining untraced neurites associated with the cell, and click 'Trace' on each (ii in Fig. 10a).\n\nCritical Step\nneuTube includes a fully automatic tracing option, but we found a semiautomatic tracing approach (which requires 1\u20132 clicks per neurite) to be faster and more reliable.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nImaris (v7.7.1) \u2022 TIMING 10 min for whole test image, less for smaller ROIs\n\n\ni\nLoad the image file. Make sure that the voxel dimensions are correct via the 'Edit\u2192Image Properties...' menu, and correct them if necessary. Use 'Display Adjustment' to adjust the contrast.\n\n\nii\nAdd a new 'Filament' to the 'Surpass Scene' session.\n\n\niii\nIn the AutoPath tracing wizard, select the 'AutoPath' algorithm and select the ROI checkbox.\n\nCritical Step\nSpecify the smallest possible ROI enclosing each neuron of interest to ensure fast processing (i in Fig. 10b and Supplementary Fig. 7b).\n\n\n\niv\nAdjust thresholds for automatic detection of starting points (i.e., soma) and seed points (ii in Fig. 10b). The goal is to have seed points distributed along the neurites, but avoid extra seed points in the background, which will slow tracing and produce errors that need to be corrected later. Depending on background noise and morphological complexity, it may be faster to identify starting and seed points by manual shift+clicking. The 'Autopath wizard' will then find paths connecting seed points into a tree of neurite segments.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\nWithin the same program (neuTube or Imaris, respectively), manually refine the automated tracing results that were that were generated in Step 16. Stepwise instructions are presented for both neuTube (option A) and Imaris (option B).\n\nA\n\nneuTube (v1.0) \u2022 TIMING 10 min\n\n\ni\nAfter initial tracing yields good coverage of neurites, select and delete erroneous nodes, add connections and extend fibers by selecting nodes and using the right-click context menu (iii and iv in Fig. 10a). See the extensive tutorial on editing at http://www.neutracing.com/manual/.\n\n\nii\nTo save tracing results, use 'File\u2192Save SWC'. Alternately, 'File\u2192Export Scaled SWC' allows the user to specify the relative scaling of the x,y and z axes to match acquisition parameters and to produce SWC data in physical units.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nImaris (v7.7.1) \u2022 TIMING 10 min\n\n\ni\nManually refine the automatically traced result from 'AutoPath'. For example, users can extend individual traced paths by adding seed points and manually editing to correct errors.\n\n\nii\nIf necessary, remove incorrect branches using 'branch select mode' and the delete key. To split branches, use the 'node select mode' and delete individual nodes. Select a pair of end points and the 'Join' option to find a path between them (iii in Fig. 10b).\n\n\niii\nTo extend neurites using the 'AutoPath' method, select the 'filament' corresponding to the traced component to be extended, and choose 'Selection as Starting Point' to perform shortest path computation. Once the computation is done (\u223c10 min for whole test image, less for smaller ROIs), the AutoPath mode will interactively trace from the cursor position back to the selected component. Shift+clicking will add the displayed candidate path (iv in Fig. 10b).\n\n\niv\nIf necessary, use the filament editing tools to perform additional operations such as smoothing filaments, estimating neurite diameter, detection and annotation of spines, and fully manual tracing (refer to user manual for details).\n\n\nv\nVisualize the resulting traces using Imaris Vantage or export tracing geometry in NEURON .hoc file format (see ref. 132, or for an up-to-date list of NEURON .hoc resources: http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/publications) for use in other analysis tools.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Step\nWe believe that the following guidelines for manipulating automated results will be broadly applicable to a variety of tracing projects. However, they do not represent an exhaustive list of the capabilities of the software, and the user should not feel limited to this set of keystrokes.\n\n\n\nTroubleshootingTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 5.Table 5 Troubleshooting PACT and PARS protocols.Full size tableTimingSteps 1\u20135, tissue preparation for PACT and PARS: 2 h\u20131 dStep 6, formation of a tissue-hydrogel matrix: 1 dSteps 7 and 8, tissue delipidation with SDS: passive, 10\u2013240 h (PACT on thin- and thick-sectioned tissue), 1 week (PACT-deCAL), or up to 1 month (whole-brain clearing via PACT); active: 1\u20134 d (PARS, all organs except brain) or 1\u20132 weeks (whole-brain clearing via PARS)Step 9, single-cell phenotyping of cleared tissues: 12 h (labeling with small-molecule dyes) to 2 weeks (primary and secondary antibody labeling and nuclear staining with 24- to 48-h wash steps)Steps 10\u201313, RIMS for PACT and PARS samples: 1 dStep 14, acquisition: 1 h to several days (variable depending on tissue volume, the number of distinct color labels or channels, the desired resolution and the microscope setup)Step 15, 3D image visualization: \u223c1 hSteps 16 and 17, 3D image analysis: variable based on analysis goalsAnticipated resultsPACT, PARS and RIMS collectively form a tissue clearing toolkit that is versatile, user-friendly and sample-friendly across tissue types. Building on past research18, we detail here how both PACT and PARS methodologies are amenable to rapid, high-throughput histopathology of rodent (Fig. 1a\u2013e) and human (Fig. 1f,g) tissue samples alike, whether through the visualization of natively expressed fluorescence markers (Figs. 1a\u2013e, 5c and 9c; Supplementary Fig. 3d,e) or through immunolabeling whole-organ and thick tissue samples (Figs. 1f,g, 4b,c, 5d and 6a; Supplementary Fig. 6b) after clearing. Furthermore, the formation of a cross-linked, tissue-hydrogel matrix allows for rigorous detergent-based clearing with only minimal leaching of proteins into the clearing buffer (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) and no detectable loss in YFP fluorescence between uncleared and cleared samples (see Yang et al.18). In addition to its RI-matching capability, RIMS also serves to preserve the molecular content of mounted samples: no protein was measured to leach out of mounted samples after a 1-week incubation, and YFP fluorescence was readily detected in cleared samples that were stored in RIMS for 3 months18. The enhanced optical transparency of delipidized and RI-matched tissues permits high-resolution detection of endogenously expressed fluorescent proteins, antibody-labeled proteins and nucleic acid transcripts at the single-molecule level (FISH18), usually with similar intensity to and lower background signals than are seen in uncleared tissues (Fig. 5c,d, confocal images for control versus cleared samples; Supplementary Fig. 4).Among the recently developed PACT variations summarized here are dedicated protocols for specialty cases within tissue clearing. These include PACT-processing of fragile tissue samples (Figs. 3,4,5), pre-PACT tissue staining with Sudan Black B to mask autofluorescence in thick tissues (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Methods), PACT-deCAL for clearing and imaging fluorescently labeled bone (Fig. 6a) and ePACT for tissue clearing through expansion (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods). With respect to the latter, PACT tissues have previously been carried through to FISH studies, in which clearing and slight tissue swelling benefitted the visualization of single, labeled transcripts18. In ePACT, cellular components that were once poorly resolved in uncleared sections become visible (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Combining these techniques offers the potential to optically distinguish multiple transcripts or otherwise packed multicolor labels (e.g., neuronal positioning system, NPS133) within the expanded sample space of a cell.To accompany these methods for chemically clearing a variety of tissue types, we extended our RIMS formulation guidelines to include recipes for different tissue types (i.e., to better match the RIs of different samples; see Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). As PACT and PARS have now been optimized to clear a wide variety of tissues, the method can further benefit from exploring alternative labeling schemes for visualizing protein and nucleic acid targets in thick tissues (Supplementary Fig. 6). Although traditional antibody-based labeling methods have been used very effectively to illuminate cell phenotype and tissue morphology (Figs. 1g and 5d and previous work18), they can be both cumbersome and costly. The slow penetration of full-format immunoglobulins in thick tissue necessitates long incubations (Fig. 4b\u2013d), to the detriment of sample integrity. Herein, camelid nanobodies (Supplementary Fig. 6) and protein affinity tags (i.e., SNAP-tag134, Halo-tag135, CLIP-tag136, TMP-tag137, and Spy Tag Catcher138) present chemically stable and potentially cost-effective alternatives. With the ability to easily penetrate thick tissue, these reagents can recognize and bind their respective targets, either a cognate antigen or tagged protein, with high specificity and rapid kinetics. In addition, by using dyes that are several-fold brighter, highly photostable and easier to separate spectrally than fluorescent proteins, protein affinity reagents can provide an excellent signal-to-noise ratio in labeled tissues139.Two major bottlenecks in the translation of fixed, unprocessed tissue banks into analyzable image databases are (i) acquisition time of thick tissues at high resolution and (ii) the computational demands to convert raw image stacks into manageable data sets for phenotypical and morphological study. Light-sheet microscopy has recently been applied to imaging large cleared volumes as it substantially reduces the acquisition time15. Here we provide a basic scheme for relatively inexpensive design of a light-sheet microscope that enables fast and high-resolution imaging of cleared samples (Fig. 9a,b and Supplementary Table 1), and we show its compatibility with PACT. A representative volume (1 mm depth) PACT-cleared mouse brain slice imaged at 45 frames per second can be seen in Figure 9c. In comparison with traditional confocal microscopes, a frame rate of 45 frames per second shows \u223c10\u2013100 times improvement in image acquisition speeds and thus allows for rapid imaging of large cleared samples, in addition to its recognized utility for live-cell imaging140. In addition to increased speed, light-sheet microscopy substantially reduces photobleaching141, which is crucial for imaging dim samples and especially for conducting smFISH experiments, in which the 20\u2013100 single fluorophore\u2013labeled probes are used to visualize individual transcripts.Regardless of the microscopy setup, image acquisitions for large tissue samples generate raw data files that are on the order of gigabytes or even terabytes in size. These data must be converted into a file format that allows data handling and visualization on computer workstations that are available to standard research laboratories. Many software packages for image analysis were not designed to accommodate such file sizes and inevitably crash partway through the computational process. Thus, we have endeavored to present a broadly applicable workflow for image data handling (Fig. 10 and Table 3), which will guide the user through the process of transferring raw image files into the image analysis software packages that we feel are most capable of performing basic functions such as tract-tracing and cell mapping.In summary, we have validated the ability of PACT, PARS and RIMS to prepare a variety of tissue samples for imaging via confocal and light-sheet microscopy. With these methods in hand, biologists may tackle the broad spectrum of scientific demands, from the meticulous analysis of isolated cell niches to the global interrogation of intact biological systems.\n\n\nReferencesChen, T.W. et al.

Slices were embedded in either A4P0B0.05 or A4P0 and then cleared with 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5). The A4P0 slices were completely clear by 144 hours. Although some heavily myelinated brain sections seemed to resist clearing in A4P0B0.05-embedded sections initially, this effect did not persist, resulting in similar overall clearing time as slices embedded without bis-acrylamide. Likewise, tissue transparency was indistinguishable between conditions after their 48-hour incubation in RIMS. Unlike in 1 mm sections (Fig. 3), bis-acrylamide did limit tissue expansion in 2mm thick slices (A4P0: 38% total average linear expansion, A4P0B0.05: 28% average linear expansion). (b) RIMS formulation guide to optimize the RI to that of the cleared sample. RIMS formulated with 82% HistodenzTM (RI = 1.4655) should be broadly applicable to cleared brain tissue, while RIMS with a higher RI of 1.48-1.49 (RIMS-1.48, RIMS-1.49) is suggested for denser cleared tissue such as bone (Fig. 6).Supplementary Figure 2 Protein loss over the course of PACT clearing.The amount of protein lost while clearing was measured by performing a BCA on the clearing buffer, which was collected and replaced periodically while 1 mm tissue samples were undergoing PACT. A standard curve of BSA protein concentration in each of the four different clearing buffers was generated. Standard curves were fit with a third order polynomial and used to extrapolate all protein loss measurements. (a) A representative case, in which the absorbance in arbitrary units (a.u.) of standard solutions at 562 nm is plotted against known BSA concentrations in 8% SDS-PBS (pH 7.5). (b) Graphs show single-trial, representative protein loss measurements for each hydrogel condition in each clearing buffer. Protein content was measured at 12 hours into clearing, at 24 hours, and then every 24 hours until the samples were clear, and normalized to the initial weight of the slice. Experiments were performed in triplicates, representative single trials for each combination are shown. (c) Time to clear for 1 mm sections PACT-processed with all hydrogel embedding and clearing buffer combinations (n = 3 for A4P1, A4P2 and Unhybridized. n = 4 for all others).Supplementary Figure 3 PACT compatibility with histological staining.(a-c) Representative images of thick section clearing with addition of CuSO4 or 0.2% SB compared to regular PACT. 0.5 mm and 1 mm coronal Thy1-YFP mouse brain sections are shown after A4P1 hydrogel polymerization (a) and during clearing with 8% SDS-BB (pH 8.5) and subsequent 24 hour incubation in RIMS (b and c for 0.5 mm and 1 mm, respectively). (d) The control, CuSO4, and 0.2% SB treated 0.5 mm slices from (a-b) were immunostained for parvalbumin (see Table 4) and then transferred to RIMS, degassed, and mounted. Shown are 500 \u03bcm thick maximum intensity projections of endogenous YFP (cyan) and parvalbumin (red) staining (top) as well as lipofuscin (white) autofluorescence (top and bottom). Red blood cell-derived (e.g. lipofuscin-like) autofluorescence was excited at 561 nm and collected between 562-606 nm. (e) Visualizing endogenous fluorescence and immunostaining deep within thick tissue. A 1 mm thick Thy1-YFP mouse brain coronal slice was treated with 0.2% SB, A4P1-embedded, cleared with 8% SDS-BB (pH 8.5), immunostained for parvalbumin (see Table 4), and then transferred to RIMS and mounted. Endogenous YFP (cyan) and immunolabeled PV (red) were imaged throughout the slice (left) in a region of the cortex. A 100 \u03bcm thick maximum intensity projection (right) was taken at a depth of 500 \u03bcm to show representative imaging in the middle of the section. Signal range of the red channel was adjusted for better visualization of PV staining at depth. All sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal with the Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 0.45 N.A. M27 air objective (w.d. 2.0 mm).Supplementary Figure 4 ePACT: a protocol for tissue clearing through expansion.(a) Fluorescence image of Thy1-YFP expression prior to expansion-clearing. A 70 \u03bcm thick maximum intensity projection of five cells expressing YFP represents the standard for imaging pre-expansion. A bright-field image of the pre-expansion 100 \u03bcm brain slice is shown in the top right, with the location of the cells being imaged indicated by the red arrowhead. Noteworthy features that may differ between pre- and post- expansion-cleared tissue, such as cell bodies, branching processes, and large projections, are numbered 1, 2, and 3, respectively. (b) Fluorescence image of Thy-YFP expression after 4\u00d7 expansion-clearing. A 340 \u03bcm thick maximum intensity projection of the same five cells in (a) is shown, with the same features labeled again 1, 2, and 3. Of note, a cell body (1) and the neuronal processes of an adjacent cell (2) are both partially obstructed by tissue lipids in (a), but can be easily identified in (b) after clearing and expansion. However, the 4\u00d7 expansion that contributes to this increased visibility through tissue also causes some tissue destruction, as apparent in the multiple severed processes, such as (3). A bright-field image of the expanded slice embedded in agarose is shown at the top right. (c) Native YFP fluorescence from the same cell in pre-expanded (blue box) and post-expanded (yellow box) tissue is shown. (d) Equipment for sample processing: (1) 2% bis-acrylamide, (2) 40% acrylamide, (3) sodium acrylate, (4) ammonium persulfate (APS), (5) N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), (6) 4-hydroxy TEMPO, (7) 20% SDS, (8) collagenase, (9) low gelling temperature agarose, (10) Entellan, and assorted, unlabeled, glass slides, spacers, and plastic dishes. All images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal with the Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 0.45 N.A. M27 air objective (w.d. 2.0 mm).Supplementary Figure 5 Whole body PARS clearing with borate-buffered detergent.(a) Mice were perfusion-fixed, A4P0-embedded, PARS-cleared for 5 days with 8% SDS-BB (pH 8.5), and washed with 1\u00d7 PBS at pH 7.5. Numbers correspond to the extracted organs in panel (b). (b) Extracted organs from the cleared mouse in panel (a), pictured before (top) and after (bottom) RIMS incubation for 3 days. Black arrowheads correspond to the adrenal gland on the kidney and to the ovaries on the fallopian tubes. Each square represents 0.5 cm2. Rodent husbandry and euthanasia conformed to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations; animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.Supplementary Figure 6 Small format antibodies for thick-tissue labeling.(a) For labeling thick tissue sections, camelid nanobodies are a promising alternative to traditional antibodies, either full immunoglobulins or their engineered formats (single-chain variable fragment (scFv), Fab, and F(ab\u2019)2). A possible workflow for nanobody production consists of: inoculating 500 ml terrific broth with 5 ml overnight cultures and grow at 37 \u00b0C until IPTG induction at OD = 0.5, then lowering the temperature to 20 \u00b0C for 10 hours for nanobody expression. Cell pellets are then lysed, carried through alternating cycles of freeze-thaw with benzonase addition, followed by a final addition of 0.1% polyethyleneimine to the pellet lysate before pelleting debris and filtering the nanobody-containing fraction. The His-tagged GFAP fusion protein is purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column. The His-tag must be removed prior to staining to avoid non-specific binding. (b) To stain for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using a GFAP camelid nanobody, 1 mm thick PACT-cleared mouse brain sections were immunostained with 1:500 Atto 488 conjugated GFAP nanobody (see Table 4) at RT overnight with shaking. The stained sections were then washed 3 times in PBST over 1 hour, followed by a 1-hour incubation in RIMS. The transparent sections were RIMS-mounted and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal with the Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 0.45 N.A. M27 air objective (w.d. 2.0 mm).

Over the next seven years, the NIH Common Fund Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) intends to develop a widely accessible framework for comprehensively mapping the human body at single-cell resolution by supporting technology development, data acquisition, and detailed spatial mapping. HuBMAP will integrate its efforts with other funding agencies, programs, consortia, and the biomedical research community at large towards the shared vision of a comprehensive, accessible three-dimensional molecular and cellular atlas of the human body, in health and under various disease conditions.\n\n\n\nMainThe human body is an incredible machine. Trillions of cells, organized across an array of spatial scales and a multitude of functional states, contribute to a symphony of physiology. While we broadly know how cells are organized in most tissues, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular states and interactive networks resident in the tissues and organs, from organizational and functional perspectives, is lacking. The specific three-dimensional organization of different cell types, together with the effects of cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix interactions in their natural milieu, have a profound impact on normal function, natural ageing, tissue remodelling, and disease progression in different tissues and organs. Recently, new technologies have enabled the molecular characterization of a multitude of cell types1,2,3,4 and mapping of their spatial relationships in complex tissues at unprecedented scale and single-cell resolution. These advances create the opportunity to build a high-resolution atlas of three-dimensional maps of human tissues and organs.HuBMAP (https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap) is an NIH-sponsored program with the goals of developing an open framework and technologies for mapping the human body at cellular resolution as well as generating foundational maps for several tissues obtained from normal individuals across a wide range of ages. A previous NIH-sponsored project, GTEx5, examined DNA variants and bulk tissue expression patterns across approximately a thousand individuals, but HuBMAP is a distinct project focused on generating molecular maps that are spatially resolved at the single-cell level but using samples from a more limited number of people. To achieve these goals, HuBMAP has been designed as a cohesive and collaborative organization, with a culture of openness and sharing using team science-based approaches6. The HuBMAP Consortium (https://hubmapconsortium.org/) will actively work with other ongoing initiatives including the Human Cell Atlas7, Human Protein Atlas8, LIfeTime (https://lifetime-fetflagship.eu/), and related NIH-funded consortia that are mapping specific organs (including the brain9, lungs (https://www.lungmap.net/), kidney (https://kpmp.org/about-kpmp/), and genitourinary (https://www.gudmap.org/) regions) and tissues (especially pre-cancer and tumours10; https://humantumoratlas.org), as well as other emerging programs.HuBMAP organization and approachesThe HuBMAP consortium comprises members with diverse expertise (for example, molecular, cellular, developmental, and computational biologists, measurement experts, clinicians, pathologists, anatomists, biomedical and software engineers, and computer and data information scientists) and is organized into three components: (1) tissue mapping centres (TMCs); (2) HuBMAP integration, visualization and engagement (HIVE) collaborative components; and (3) innovative technologies groups (transformative technology development (TTD) and rapid technology implementation (RTI)) (Fig. 1). Throughout the program, HuBMAP will increase the range of tissues and technologies studied through a series of funding opportunities that have been designed to be synergistic with other NIH-funded and international efforts. In the later stages of HuBMAP, demonstration projects will be added to show the utility of the generated resources and, importantly, to engage the wider research community to analyse HuBMAP data alongside data from other programs or their own labs.Fig. 1: The HubMAP consortium.The TMCs will collect tissue samples and generate spatially resolved, single-cell data. Groups involved in TTD and RTI initiatives will develop emerging and more developed technologies, respectively; in later years, these will be implemented at scale. Data from all groups will be rendered useable for the biomedical community by the HuBMAP integration, visualization and engagement (HIVE) teams. The groups will collaborate closely to iteratively refine the atlas as it is gradually realized.Full size imageTissue and data generationThe HuBMAP TMCs will collect and analyse a broad range of largely normal tissues, representing both sexes, different ethnicities and a variety of ages across the adult lifespan. These tissues (Fig. 2) include: (1) discrete, complex organs (kidney, ureter, bladder, lung, breast, small intestine and\u00a0colon); (2) distributed organ systems (vasculature); and (3) systems comprising dynamic or motile cell types with distinct microenvironments (lymphatic organs: spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes). Tissue will be collected at precisely defined anatomical locations (when possible, photographically recorded) according to established protocols that preserve tissue quality and minimize degradation. Beyond meeting standard regulatory requirements, to the greatest extent possible, consent will be obtained so that the\u00a0generated data is available for\u00a0open-access data sharing (that is, public access without approval by data committees), to maximize their usage by the biomedical community.Fig. 2: Key tissues and organs initially analysed by the consortium.Using innovative, production-grade (\u2018shovel ready\u2019) technologies, HuBMAP TMCs will generate data for single-cell, three-dimensional maps of various human tissues. In parallel, TTD projects (and later RTI projects) will refine assays and analysis tools on a largely distinct set of human tissues. Samples from individuals of both sexes and different ages will be studied. The range of tissues will be expanded throughout the program.Full size imageTo achieve spatially resolved, single-cell maps, the TMCs will use a complementary, iterative, two-step approach (Fig. 3). First, \u2019omic assays, which are extremely efficient for data acquisition, will be used to generate global genome sequence and gene expression profiles of dissociated single cells or nuclei in a massively parallel manner. The molecular state of each cell will be revealed by single-cell transcriptomic11 and, in many cases, chromatin accessibility12,13 assays; imputation of transcription factor binding regions from the open chromatin data combined with the gene expression data will be used to explain the regulation of gene expression across the distinct cell types14. Second, spatial information (abundance, identities, and localization) will be acquired for various biomolecules (RNA15, protein16, metabolites, and lipids) in tissue sections or blocks, using imaging methodologies such as fluorescent microscopy (confocal, multiphoton, lightsheet, and expansion), sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH)17,18, imaging mass spectrometry19,20, and imaging mass cytometry (IMC)21,22,23,24. The extensive single-cell and nucleus profiles obtained will inform in situ modalities (for example, single-cell or nucleus RNA sequencing will be used to choose probes for RNA or proteins), which will provide spatial information for up to hundreds of molecular targets of interest. These data will allow the computational registration of cell-specific epigenomic or transcriptomic profiles to cells on a histological slide to reveal various microenvironmental states. They will potentially include information about protein localization to cytoplasm, nucleus, or cell surface; phosphorylation; complex assembly; extracellular environment; and cellular phenotype determined by protein marker coexpression. Registration and computational integration of complex imaging data will provide biological insights beyond any single imaging mode19,25. The powerful combination of single-cell profiling and multiplexed in situ imaging will provide a pipeline for constructing multi-omics spatial maps for the various human organs and their cellular interactions at a molecular level.Fig. 3: Map generation and assembly across cellular and spatial scales.HuBMAP aims to produce an atlas in which users can refer to a histological slide from a specific part of an organ and, in any given cell, understand its contents on multiple \u2019omic levels\u2014genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and/or metabolomic. To achieve these ends, centres will apply a combination of imaging, \u2019omics and mass spectrometry techniques to specimens collected in a reproducible manner from specific sites in the body. These data will be then be integrated to arrive at a high-resolution, high-content three-dimensional map for any given tissue. To ensure inter-individual differences will not be confounded with collection heterogeneity, a robust CCF will be developed.Full size imageThe TMCs will use complementary methods for data collection with an emphasis on processes to ensure the generation of high-quality data and standardized metadata annotations. Benchmarking, quality assurance and control standards, and standard operating procedures, where appropriate, will be developed for each stage of the methodological process and be made available to promote rigor, reproducibility and transparency. It is expected that quality assurance and control standards for both biospecimens and data will evolve as tissue collection, processing techniques, storage and shipping conditions, assays, and data-processing tools change, and as HuBMAP interacts and collaborates with other related efforts, as they have for other consortium projects26,27,28,29,30,31. Where possible, metadata related to preanalytical variables (for example, annotations and nomenclature) and technologies will be harmonized, and protocols and standards will be shared with the wider research community.Building an integrated tissue map across scalesThe diversity of data generated by HuBMAP, ranging across macroscopic and microscopic scales (for example, anatomical, histological, cellular, molecular and genomic) and multiple individuals, is essential to its core mission. Exploring each of these valuable datasets collectively will yield an integrated view of the human body. Hence, HuBMAP will develop analytical and visualization tools to bridge spatial and molecular relationships in order to help to generate a high-resolution three-dimensional molecular atlas of the human body.The volume of data generated and collected by HuBMAP will require the utilization, extension and development of tools and pipelines for data processing. While we expect that initial data-processing tools will be based on methods developed by consortium members, HuBMAP will also work with and incorporate algorithms developed by other programs and the wider research community to supplement, enhance or update its pipelines. To this end, HuBMAP will develop one or more portals tailored to emerging use cases identified through a series of user needs. These open source portals will use recognized standards and be interoperable with other platforms, such as the HCA Data Coordination Platform, making it possible to readily add, update, and use new software modules (for example, as with Dockstore32 and Toil33). The portion of HuBMAP data that will be open source can live on or be accessed from multiple platforms, enhancing its utility. This infrastructure will enable external developers to apply their codes, applications, open application programming interfaces, and data schema to facilitate customized processing and analysis of HuBMAP data in concert with other data sources. Furthermore, by actively working with other global and NIH initiatives, the consortium will seek to reduce the barriers to browsing, searching, aggregating, and analysing data across portals and platforms.To fully integrate spatial and molecular data across individuals, HuBMAP will create a common coordinate framework (CCF) that defines a three-dimensional spatial representation, leveraging both an early consortium-wide effort to standardize technologies and assays using a single common tissue and the broader range of tissues of the human body analysed across multiple scales (whole body to single cells). This spatial representation will serve as an addressable scaffold for all HuBMAP data, enabling unified interactive exploration and visualization (search, filter, details on demand) and facilitating comparative analysis across individuals, technologies, and laboratories34,35. To achieve these objectives, HuBMAP envisions a strategy inspired by other tissue atlas efforts36,37,38 that leverages the identification of \u2018landmark\u2019 features, including key anatomical structures and canonical components of tissue organization (for example, epidermal boundaries and normally spatially invariant vasculature) that can be identified in all individuals. These landmarks will enable a \u2018semi-supervised\u2019 strategy for aligning and assembling an integrated reference, upon which HuBMAP investigators can impose diverse coordinate systems, including relative representations and zone-based projections. As one example, an open-source, computational histology topography cytometry analysis toolbox (histoCAT39) currently facilitates two-dimensional visualization and will soon also be applicable to three-dimensional reconstruction. Ontology-based frameworks will be explored in parallel to effectively categorize, navigate, and name multiscale data; synergies are expected between these two approaches. Whenever available, medical imaging, such as CT and MRI information, will serve as a basis for landmarking and constructing the CCF.Technology development and implementationQuantitative imaging of different classes of biomolecule in the same tissue sample with high spatial resolution, sensitivity, specificity, and throughput is central to the development of detailed tissue maps. Although no single technique can fully address this challenge at present, the development and subsequent multiplexing of complementary capabilities provides a promising approach for accelerating tissue mapping efforts. The HuBMAP innovation technologies groups aim to develop several innovative approaches that will address the limitations of existing state-of-the-art techniques. For example, transformative technologies such as signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER)40,41, seqFISH18,42,43, and Lumiphore probes44 will be refined to improve multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput for imaging RNA and proteins across multiple tissues. Furthermore, new mass spectrometry imaging techniques will enable the quantitative mapping of hundreds of lipids, metabolites, and proteins from the same tissue section with high spatial resolution and sensitivity45,46. There is also scope within the program to develop and test new technologies. These efforts will benefit from the development of new computational tools and machine learning algorithms, optimized first from data generated from a common tissue during the pilot phase, for data integration across modalities.ChallengesPrevious programs such as GTEx5 have faced the challenge of optimizing the collection, preservation, and processing of a wide variety of tissue types from multiple donors. However, one of the goals of HuBMAP, to generate comprehensive, interactive high-resolution maps using a wide variety of assays, introduces an added level of complexity. Mapping functionally important biomolecules, including some of which we may not even be aware and for which sensitive, specific, and high-throughput assays are still lacking, will require close attention. Moreover, the program will produce an unprecedented volume and diversity of datasets for comprehensive data capture, management, mining, modelling, visual exploration and communication. The integration of data from different modalities is required for generating robust maps; it will be necessary to develop corresponding analysis and interactive visualization tools to ensure that the data and atlas are accessible to the entire life-sciences community. Finally, given the enormity of a human atlas, HuBMAP faces the challenges of prioritization of tissues and technologies, sampling across tissues and donors, and optimally synergizing its efforts with international efforts. Determining the number of cells, fields of view, and samples needed to capture rare cell types, states or tissue structures is an important challenge, but can be tackled with adaptive power analyses, leveraging the growing amount of data available both within HuBMAP and from other consortia as well as individual groups.Resources and community engagementHuBMAP is an important part of the international mission to build a high-resolution cellular and spatial map of the human body, and we are firmly committed to close collaboration and synergy with the aforementioned initiatives to build an easy-to-use platform and interoperable datasets that will accelerate the realization of a high-resolution human atlas. Shared guiding principles around open data, tools, and access will enable collaborative and integrated analyses of data produced by diverse consortia. To achieve this synergy, HuBMAP and other consortia will work together to tackle common computational challenges, such as cellular annotation, through formal and informal gatherings focused on addressing these problems, planned joint benchmarking and hands-on jamborees and workshops. Another example of the potential for close collaboration is in the study of the colon; multiple projects funded by HuBMAP, the Human Tumour Atlas Network, and the Wellcome Trust will be complemented by projects funded by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. With projects focusing on partly distinct regions and diseases (for example, normal tissue, colon cancer, and Crohn\u2019s disease), it will be important for all of\u00a0the programs to ensure that data are collected and made available in a consistent manner, and HuBMAP will play an active part in such efforts. As a concrete next step, HuBMAP, in collaboration with other NIH programs, plans to hold a joint meeting with the Human Cell Atlas initiative to identify and work on areas of harmonization and collaboration during the spring of 2020. In parallel, HubMAP participants engage in the meetings and activities of other consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas or the Human Tumour Atlas Network, thus forming tight connections. We have started a series of open meetings to develop the CCF, with the first of these recently held in collaboration with the Kidney Precision Medicine Program and focused on the kidney.HuBMAP will provide capabilities for data submission, access, and analysis following FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data principles47. We will develop policies for prompt and regular data releases in commonly used formats, consistent with similar initiatives. We anticipate that the first round of data will be released in the summer of 2020, with subsequent releases at timely intervals thereafter. Robust metadata will comprise all aspects of labelling and provenance, including de-identified donor information (both demographic and clinical), details of tissue processing and protocols, data levels, and processing pipelines.Indeed, engagement and outreach to the broader scientific community and other mapping centres is central to ensure that resources generated by HuBMAP will be leveraged broadly for sustained impact. To ensure that browsers and visualization tools from HuBMAP are valuable, the consortium will work closely with anatomists, pathologists, and visualization and user experience experts, including those with expertise in virtual or augmented reality. As described above, we expect that the diversity of normal samples included in this project will facilitate valuable comparative analyses, pinpointing how cells and tissue structures vary across individuals, throughout the lifespan, and in the emergence of dysfunction and disease. The program will build its resources with these use cases in mind and provide future opportunities, such as the demonstration projects, for close collaboration with domain experts. We also anticipate that these data will be highly useful for the generation of new biomedical hypotheses, tissue engineering, the development of robust simulations of spatiotemporal interactions, machine learning of tissue features, and educational purposes.ConclusionsAnalogous to the release of the first human genome build, we anticipate that the first reference three-dimensional tissue maps will represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of their ultimate scope and eventual impact. HuBMAP, working closely with other initiatives, aspires to help to build a foundation by generating a high-resolution atlas of key organs in the normal human body and capturing inter-individual differences, as well as acting as a key resource for new contributions in the growing fields of tissue biology and cellular ecosystems. Given the focus of HuBMAP on spatial molecular mapping, the consortium will contribute to the community of efforts seeking similar goals, with a special emphasis on providing leadership in the development of analytical methods for its data types and for developing a common coordinate framework to integrate data. Ultimately, we hope to catalyse novel views on the organization of tissues, regarding not only which types of cells are neighbouring one another, but also the gene and protein expression patterns that define these cells, their phenotypes, and functional interactions. In addition to encouraging the establishment of intra- and extra-consortium collaborations that align with HuBMAP\u2019s overall mission, we envision an easily accessible, publicly available user interface through which data can be used to visualize molecular landscapes at the single-cell level, pathways and networks for molecules of interest, and spatial and temporal changes across a given cell type of interest. Researchers will also be able to browse, search, download, and analyse the data in standard formats with rich metadata that, over time, will enable users to query and analyse datasets across similar programs.Importantly, we believe that the project\u2019s compilation of different types of multi-omic information at the single-cell level in a spatially resolved manner will represent an important step in the advancement of our understanding of human biology and precision medicine. These data have the potential to redefine types or subtypes of cells and their relationships within and between tissues beyond the traditional understanding that can be obtained through standard methods (for example, microscopy\u00a0and flow cytometry). We hope this work will be part of a foundation that enables diagnostic interrogation, modelling, navigation, and targeted therapeutic interventions at such an unprecedented resolution to be transformative for the biomedical field.\n\n\nReferencesSvensson, V. et al.

Here, we demonstrate a multiplexed single-molecule in situ method, intron seqFISH, that allows imaging of 10,421 genes at their nascent transcription active sites in single cells, followed by mRNA and lncRNA seqFISH and immunofluorescence. This nascent transcriptome-profiling method can identify different cell types and states with mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. The nascent sites of RNA synthesis tend to be localized on the surfaces of chromosome territories, and their organization in individual cells is highly variable. Surprisingly, the global nascent transcription oscillated asynchronously in individual cells with a period of 2\u00a0hr in mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as in fibroblasts. Together, spatial genomics of the nascent transcriptome by intron seqFISH reveals nuclear organizational principles and fast dynamics in single cells that are otherwise obscured.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (180KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsseqFISHoscillationsnascent transcriptomeintronchromosomesmFISHtranscriptionRecommended articlesCited by (0)5Current Address: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA6These authors contributed equally7Lead Contact\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Preserving spatial relationships while accessing the transcriptome of selected cells is a crucial feature for advancing many biological areas \u2013 from developmental biology to neuroscience. However, because of the high autofluorescence background of many tissue samples, it is difficult to detect single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) signals robustly in opaque thick samples. Here, we draw on principles from the emerging discipline of dynamic nucleic acid nanotechnology to develop a robust method for multi-color, multi-RNA imaging in deep tissues using single-molecule hybridization chain reaction (smHCR). Using this approach, single transcripts can be imaged using epifluorescence, confocal or selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) depending on the imaging depth required. We show that smHCR has high sensitivity in detecting mRNAs in cell culture and whole-mount zebrafish embryos, and that combined with SPIM and PACT (passive CLARITY technique) tissue hydrogel embedding and clearing, smHCR can detect single mRNAs deep within thick (0.5\u2005mm) brain slices. By simultaneously achieving \u223c20-fold signal amplification and diffraction-limited spatial resolution, smHCR offers a robust and versatile approach for detecting single mRNAs in situ, including in thick tissues where high background undermines the performance of unamplified smFISH.\n\n\n\n\nKeywords:\nCLARITY,\nAmplification,\nSingle-molecule RNA\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nImaging gene expression levels with single-cell resolution in intact tissues is essential for understanding the genetic programs in many systems, such as developing embryos and dynamic brain circuits. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) has been the standard tool for detection of individual RNAs in cells (Femino et al., 1998; Raj et al., 2008,, 2006; Levsky et al., 2002; Fan et al., 2001). Using smFISH, an mRNA is detected by a probe set containing 20-40 DNA probes, each carrying one or more fluorophores, and each complementary to a different short subsequence (20-50 nt) along the mRNA target. This approach ensures that multiple probes bind the mRNA, generating bright puncta that can be discriminated from background staining resulting from non-specific binding of individual probes. However, background due to sample autofluorescence is significantly higher in tissue samples than in cell culture, making it difficult to robustly detect smFISH signals in tissue. In addition, light scattering caused by deep tissue imaging necessitates probes with higher photon counts than for thin section imaging. Although we have shown that tissue clearing by PACT (passive CLARITY technique) can alleviate autofluorescence and light scattering problems (Chung et al., 2013; Treweek et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014) while preserving RNA molecules (Yang et al., 2014), a more robust signal amplification strategy is needed to enable multi-color mapping of single mRNAs in deep tissues (Fig.\u00a0S1).\n\n\nAttempts have been made to specifically amplify a single mRNA signal, but these tend to suffer from low efficiency and complex protocols (Player et al., 2001). Here, we describe a simple and efficient method for multiplexed single-molecule signal amplification based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) (Dirks and Pierce, 2004; Choi et al., 2010,, 2014). With this approach, short DNA probes complementary to mRNA targets trigger chain reactions in which metastable fluorophore-labeled DNA hairpins self-assemble into tethered fluorescent amplification polymers (Fig.\u00a01A). As with smFISH, each target mRNA is addressed by 20-40 probes complementary to different subsequences along the target to enable discrimination between mRNAs with multiple probes bound and dots resulting from non-specific binding of individual probes. In contrast to previous in situ HCR methods (Choi et al., 2010,, 2014), we limit the HCR amplification time to achieve a mean polymer length of \u223c20-40 hairpins, generating puncta that are bright enough for high sensitivity, yet small enough for diffraction-limited resolution (Fig.\u00a0S2). Using orthogonal HCR amplifiers programmed to operate independently, straightforward multiplexing is achieved for up to five channels simultaneously (Fig.\u00a01B, Table S1). We term this method single-molecule HCR (smHCR).\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nTo characterize the sensitivity and selectivity of smHCR in cultured cells, we performed a colocalization experiment in which a low-copy target mRNA (Pcdha constant region) was simultaneously detected using three probe sets of 22 probes each (one smFISH set and two smHCR sets), with the probes alternating between the three sets along the target (Table S2). Dots were identified in each channel by applying a threshold following standard methods for smFISH data analysis (Fig.\u00a0S3A) (Raj et al., 2008). We define true mRNA signals as those dots that are colocalized in at least two of the three channels (Fig.\u00a01C). We calculate a true positive rate for a given channel as the percentage of true mRNA signals detected as dots in that channel. We calculate a false positive rate for a given channel as the percentage of dots in that channel that are not true mRNA signals. For the two smHCR channels and the smFISH channel, the true positive rates are all approximately 88% (Fig.\u00a01D), and the false positive rates are approximately 36%, 27% and 20%, respectively (Fig.\u00a0S3B). Comparing dot intensities, smHCR provides signal amplification in the region of \u223c15- to 35-fold relative to smFISH (Fig.\u00a0S3C,D and Fig. S4), a feature that will become crucial in detecting single transcripts in tissues that have higher levels of autofluorescence. \n\n\nFig. 1.View largeDownload slideSingle-molecule hybridization chain reaction (smHCR). (A) smHCR protocol. Detection stage: an mRNA target is detected by a probe set containing 20-40 short DNA probes, each binding a 20-30 nt subsequence of the target; each probe in the probe set carries an initiator for the same HCR amplifier. Amplification stage: metastable fluorophore-labeled DNA HCR hairpins penetrate the sample and self-assemble into fluorescent amplification polymers tethered to their initiating probes. The same two-stage protocol is used for multiplexed studies: during the detection stage, all probe sets are introduced simultaneously, each carrying an initiator for an orthogonal HCR amplifier; during the amplification stage, all HCR amplifiers are introduced simultaneously, each labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores. (B) Simultaneous mapping of five target mRNAs in cultured CAD cells using five spectrally distinct HCR amplifiers (DAPI in blue): Pgk1 (Cy7), Ppia (Alexa Fluor 647), Gusb (Alexa Fluor 594), Pcdha (Cy3b), Pcdhg (Alexa Fluor 488).

See Figs\u00a0S2-S5 for additional data.\n\n\nNotably, in experimental designs where two channels can be allocated to each target mRNA, near-quantitative single-molecule mapping can be achieved (Fig.\u00a0S5). Using this approach, the threshold for dot identification is lowered in each channel to achieve a higher true positive rate (>95%) at the cost of a higher false positive rate (>60%). Dot colocalization between channels can then be used to identify the subset of dots that represent true mRNA signals. Alternatively, for the standard situation where each target is detected in only a single channel, and hence colocalization cannot be used for dot classification, the threshold must be raised to reject false positives at the cost of also rejecting some true positives, as is the case for smFISH (Fig.\u00a0S5) (Raj et al., 2008).\n\n\nTo examine the performance of smHCR within the more challenging imaging setting of an intact vertebrate embryo, we repeated the three-channel colocalization study in a whole-mount zebrafish embryo with confocal imaging. The target mRNA, kdrl (a medium-copy target expressed in the endothelial cells of blood vessels), is detected using three smHCR probe sets of 39 probes each, with probes alternating between the three sets along the target mRNA (Table S3). For the three smHCR channels, we observe true positive rates of 86%, 84% and 86% (Fig.\u00a02B), and false positive rates of 36%, 21% and 31% (Fig.\u00a0S6). To compare the properties of smHCR and smFISH in zebrafish embryos, we disabled HCR amplification in the Alexa Fluor 546 channel by introducing only the first HCR hairpin species, enabling only one hairpin carrying one fluorophore to bind to each probe (smFISH* in Fig.\u00a02C; compare the dots in the middle panels of A and C). Comparing the signal intensities of smHCR and smFISH*, we find that the ratio of median dot intensities for smHCR and smFISH* is approximately 15 (Fig.\u00a02D). While the autofluorescence in zebrafish embryos is low enough that unamplified smFISH remains viable (Oka and Sato, 2015; Stapel et al., 2016; Figs\u00a0S6-S8), automated signal detection is facilitated by the greater signal to background ratio of smHCR. \n\n\nFig. 2.View largeDownload slideImaging single mRNAs within whole-mount zebrafish embryos using smHCR.

See Figs\u00a0S6-S8 for additional data.\n\n\nIn the higher background of adult mouse brain sections, smHCR signal amplification becomes essential for robust detection of individual transcripts and is also important when mapping bulk expression in cleared tissue (Sylwestrak et al., 2016). To minimize autofluorescence and light scattering, PACT clearing turns tissues optically transparent and macromolecule-permeable by removing lipids and replacing them with a porous hydrogel, while immersion in RIMS matches the refractive index throughout the sample (Treweek et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014). We hypothesized that PACT and RIMS combined with smHCR should enable reliable single-molecule imaging at depth within brain samples. As a first test, we used confocal microscopy to image PACT-cleared brain slices at depths up to 84\u2005\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a03), performing a three-channel colocalization study using two smHCR probe sets and one smFISH probe set (Table S4). Using smFISH, few dots are visible at a depth of 10\u2005\u00b5m, and no signal is evident at a depth of 37\u2005\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a03A, bottom). This situation contrasts with the two smHCR channels, where dots remain bright at a depth of 70\u2005\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a03A, middle and top). For each of the two smHCR channels, the true positive rate is approximately >90% (Fig.\u00a03B, top) and the false positive rate is approximately 20% (Fig.\u00a03B, bottom) across the full range of depths. For the smFISH channel, the true positive rate is dramatically lower and the false positive rate is dramatically higher at all depths (Fig.\u00a03B). \n\n\nFig. 3.View largeDownload slideImaging single mRNAs in adult mouse brain sections using smHCR and PACT.

Target: Pgk1. Microscopy: spinning disk confocal. Probe sets: 22 or 23 probes per set, each addressing a 20\u00a0nt target subsequence. See Fig.\u00a0S9 for additional data.\n\n\nTo further examine the role of tissue clearing in smRNA detection at depth, we calculated the absolute number of colocalized dots per imaging voxel for pairs of channels with and without PACT (Fig.\u00a03C). Owing to the high level and ubiquitous nature of Pgk1 expression, two samples when imaged in the same relative locations (layer I-layer II/III of parietal cortex) should show similar transcript numbers per unit volume. With PACT, the two smHCR channels show no measurable decline in colocalized dot count as a function of depth, but without PACT, the dot count decreases at depths beyond \u223c15\u2005\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a03C left). PACT also significantly reduces the background dot count resulting from autofluorescence (Fig.\u00a03D). Comparisons between smHCR and smFISH emphasize the lack of signal using smFISH (Fig.\u00a03C, right).\n\n\nAlthough confocal microscopy rejects out-of-focus background, image acquisition is slow, out-of-plane excitation can photobleach the sample and the imaging depth is limited compared with SPIM. SPIM (Huisken et al., 2004; Dodt et al., 2007; Keller et al., 2010; Tomer et al., 2014; Baumgart and Kubitscheck, 2012) offers a fast alternative (\u223c100 times faster than confocal microscopy) that rejects out-of-focus noise by illuminating and capturing images only from a thin selective plane, typically on the order of 1-10\u2005\u00b5m. As smFISH signal is undetectable with SPIM, if SPIM, PACT and smHCR are compatible, it would become feasible to efficiently perform phenotypical studies with single-molecule resolution while preserving the natural long-range architecture of thick samples. To examine the performance of SPIM, PACT and smHCR, we first mapped the expression patterns for two mRNAs (Ctgf and Gfap) in 250\u00a0\u03bcm brain slices, recapitulating the large-scale reference patterns in the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) (Fig.\u00a04A and Movie\u00a01), but now with single-molecule resolution (Fig.\u00a04B). To further characterize SPIM performance, we mapped single Scg10 mRNAs (a medium to high copy number target) at depths up to 0.5\u2005mm in PACT-cleared brain slices (Fig.\u00a04C and Movie\u00a02). Examining true positive (Fig.\u00a04D) and false positive (Fig.\u00a0S10) rates for three smHCR channels reveals that SPIM extends the sensitivity and selectivity achieved with confocal microscopy to significantly greater depths (see Figs\u00a0S11 and S12 for an illustration of image analysis and dot classification for smHCR/PACT/SPIM data in thick samples). Additional studies mapping a high-copy transgenic mRNA in 1\u00a0mm brain slices from Thy1-EYFP mice revealed strong and selective HCR signal at depth (Figs\u00a0S13-S16 and Movie\u00a03), although in this case the expression level of the target was too high to resolve individual dots. Notably though, as PACT-cleared tissue retains endogenous YFP fluorescence, we were able to directly test the selectivity of HCR signal without the need for parallel antibody staining; we observe a one-to-one correspondence between cells labeled by YFP protein fluorescence and cells expressing YFP mRNA by smHCR. \n\n\nFig. 4.View largeDownload slideImaging single mRNAs in thick adult mouse brain sections using smHCR, PACT and SPIM.

(A) Ctgf and Gfap expression based on: reference Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) composite (Ctgf-RP_040407_02_H07-coronal slice #16 and Gfap-RP_Baylor_253913 coronal slice #16, sections were selected and overlaid based on the ventricle outline) (left panel) and two-channel smHCR with PACT and SPIM (right panel). Images were generated by stitching together tiled fields of view (1.2\u00d71.2\u00a0mm) acquired in SPIM. The SPIM image shows a maximum intensity projection of a 250\u00a0\u00b5m stack of images. Consistent with the ABA-based overlay, the SPIM images show Ctgf highly expressed in the deepest cortical layer and Gfap expressed in the white matter astrocytes. (B) High-magnification confocal images at two locations within the same sample (approximate locations denoted by arrows in A). DAPI in blue. (C) Scg10 mRNA imaged in three channels at three depths using smHCR (IR800, Alexa Fluor 647, Cy3B), PACT and SPIM. (D) True positive rates as a function of depth (median\u00b1median absolute deviation, N=3 sections from different brains) using SPIM or confocal imaging of Scg10.

In combination with PACT and SPIM, smHCR enables efficient mapping of single transcripts in thick brain slices, allowing the spatial architecture of the tissue to be preserved. Noting that whole bodies and a wide range of tissues, including human, have been successfully cleared (Treweek et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014), we expect the combination of smHCR, PACT and SPIM to enable molecular profiling of a wide variety of samples with single-cell and, if desired, single-transcript resolution while preserving geometry and connectivity information. As smHCR is compatible with sequential hybridization methods that we have previously developed (Lubeck et al., 2014; Lubeck and Cai, 2012), it should be possible to perform highly multiplexed studies within thick autofluorescent samples, mapping single mRNAs at depth.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nSample preparation\n\n\nWhole-mount zebrafish embryos were prepared using a protocol adapted from Choi et al.

Here we present Giotto, a comprehensive and open-source toolbox for spatial data analysis and visualization. The analysis module provides end-to-end analysis by implementing a wide range of algorithms for characterizing tissue composition, spatial expression patterns, and cellular interactions. Furthermore, single-cell RNAseq data can be integrated for spatial cell-type enrichment analysis. The visualization module allows users to interactively visualize analysis outputs and imaging features. To demonstrate its general applicability, we apply Giotto to a wide range of datasets encompassing diverse technologies and platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductionMost tissues consist of multiple cell types that operate together to perform their functions. The behavior of each cell is in turn mediated by its tissue environment. With the rapid development of single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) technologies in the last decade, most attention has gone to unraveling the composition of cell types with each tissue. However, recent studies have also shown that identical cell types may have tissue-specific expression patterns [1, 2], indicating that the tissue environment plays an important role in mediating cell states. Since spatial information is lost during the process of tissue dissociation and cell isolation, the scRNAseq technology is intrinsically limited for studying the structural organization of a complex tissue and interactions between cells and their tissue environment.Recently, a number of technological advances have enabled transcriptomic/proteomic profiling in a spatially resolved manner [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14] such that cellular features (for example transcripts or proteins) can be assigned to single cells for which the original cell location information is retained (Fig.\u00a01a, inset). Applications of these technologies have revealed distinct spatial patterns that previously are only inferred through indirect means [15, 16]. There is an urgent need for standardized spatial analysis tools that can facilitate comprehensive exploration of the current and upcoming spatial datasets [17, 18]. To fill this important gap, we present the first comprehensive, standardized, and user-friendly toolbox, called Giotto, that allows researchers to process, (re-)analyze, and interactively visualize spatial transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. Giotto implements a rich set of algorithms to enable robust spatial data analysis and further provides an easy-to-use workspace for interactive data visualization and exploration. As such, the Giotto toolbox serves as a convenient entry point for spatial transcriptomic/proteomic data analysis and visualization. We have applied Giotto to a wide range of public datasets to demonstrate its general applicability.\nFig. 1The Giotto framework to analyze and visualize spatial expression data. a Schematic representation of the Giotto workflow to analyze and visualize spatial expression data. Giotto Analyzer requires a count matrix and physical coordinates for the corresponding cells. It follows standard scRNAseq processing and analysis steps to identify differentially expressed genes and cell types. In the following step, a spatial grid and neighborhood network is created which is further used to incorporate the spatial information of the single-cell environment and which is used for spatial analysis. b Cell coordinates, annotations, and clustering information are utilized and incorporated in the Giotto Viewer. This interactive viewer allows users to explore the link between cells\u2019 physical positions and their clustering pattern in the expression space (UMAP or tSNE). The addition of raw subcellular transcript coordinates, staining images, or cell segmentation information is also supported. c Overview of the selected broad range of different spatial technologies and datasets which were analyzed and visualized with Giotto. For each dataset the number of features (genes or proteins) and number of cells are shown before filtering. The technologies depicted are sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization plus (seqFISH+), Visium 10X (Visium), Slide-seq, cyclic-ouroboros single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (osmFISH), multiplexed error-robust fluorescent in situ hybridization (merFISH), spatially resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping (STARmap), tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF), Multiplex Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), and CO-Detection by indexing (CODEX)Full size imageResultsOverview of the Giotto toolboxGiotto provides a comprehensive spatial analysis toolbox that contains two independent yet fully integrated modules (Fig.\u00a01a, b). The first module (Giotto Analyzer) provides step-by-step instructions about the different steps in analyzing spatial single-cell expression data, whereas the second module (Giotto Viewer) provides a responsive and interactive viewer of such data on the user\u2019s local computer. These two modules can be used either independently or iteratively.Giotto Analyzer requires as minimal input a gene-by-cell count matrix and the spatial coordinates for the centroid position of each cell (Fig.\u00a01a). At the basic level, Giotto Analyzer can be used to perform common steps often similar to scRNAseq analysis, such as pre-processing, feature selection, dimension reduction, and unsupervised clustering; on the other hand, the main strength comes from its ability to integrate gene expression and spatial information in order to gain insights into the structural and functional organization of a tissue and its expression patterns. To this end, Giotto Analyzer creates a spatial grid and neighborhood network connecting cells that are physically close to each other. These objects function as the basis to perform analyses that are associated with cell neighborhoods.Giotto Analyzer is written in the popular language R. The core data structure is the Giotto object, which is specifically designed for spatial expression data analysis based on the flexible S4 object system in R. The Giotto object stores all necessary (spatial) information and is sufficient to perform all calculations and analyses (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S1A). This allows the user to quickly evaluate and create their own flexible pipeline for both spatial visualization and data analysis. The Giotto Viewer module is designed to both interactively explore the outputs of Giotto Analyzer and to visualize additional information such as cell morphology and transcript locations (Fig.\u00a01b). Giotto Viewer provides an interactive workspace allowing users to easily explore the data in both physical and expression space and identify relationships between different data modalities. Taken together, these two modules provide an integrated toolbox for spatial expression data analysis and visualization.The spatial omics field is diverse and rapidly expanding; each technology has its strength and weaknesses. In order to demonstrate the general applicability of Giotto, we selected and analyzed 10 public datasets obtained from 9 state-of-the-art technologies (Fig.\u00a01c, Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S1), which differ in terms of resolution (single-cell vs multiple cells), physical dimension (2D vs 3D), molecular modality (protein vs RNA), number of cells and genes, and tissue of origin. Throughout this paper, we use these datasets to highlight the rich set of analysis tools that are supported by Giotto.Cell type identification and data visualizationGiotto Analyzer starts by identifying different cell types that are present in a spatial transcriptomic or proteomic dataset. As an illustrating example for the first common steps, we considered the seqFISH+ mouse somatosensory cortex dataset, which profiled 10,000 genes in hundreds of cells at single-cell resolution using super-resolved imaging [9]. The input gene-by-cell count matrix was first pre-processed through a sequence of steps including normalization, quality control of raw counts, and adjustment for batch effects or technical variations. Then downstream analyses were carried out for highly variable gene selection (Additional\u00a0file 1: Fig. S1B), dimensionality reduction (such as PCA, tSNE [19], and UMAP [20]), and clustering (such as Louvain [21] and Leiden clustering algorithms [22]) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1C). Cluster-specific marker genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S1D-E) were identified through a number of algorithms (such as Scran [23] and MAST [24]) and a new algorithm based on Gini coefficients [25]. Whereas the strongest marker genes are typically identified by all three methods, each method has its own strength in detecting specific types of genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A-G, see Methods and Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Supplementary Notes for details). In total, we identified 12 distinct cell types, including layer-specific excitatory neurons (eNeurons) (Syt17 in layer 2/3, Grm2 in layer 4, Islr2 in layer 5/6), two types of inhibitory neurons (iNeurons) (Lhx6 vs Adarb2), astrocytes (Gli3), oligodendrocytes (Plekhh), oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) (Sox10), endothelial cells (Cldn5), mural (Vtn), and microglia (Itgam) cells. The distribution of these cell types can then be visualized in both expression and physical space (Additional file 1: Fig. S1F).Next, we analyzed additional complex imaging-based spatial transcriptomic datasets generated by merFISH [14], STARmap [7], and osmFISH [11]. In the merFISH dataset, 12 selected thin slices from a 3D mouse pre-optic cortex sample were imaged, resulting in a total of roughly 75,000 cells and 155 genes. Here Giotto was used to identify 8 distinct clusters. Based on known marker genes, we were able to annotate these clusters as microglia (Selplg), ependymal cells (Cd24a), astrocytes (Aqp4), endothelial cells (Fn1), mature (Mbp), and immature (Pdgfra) oligodendrocytes, excitatory (Slc17a6) and inhibitory (Gad1) neurons, respectively, which is in agreement with the original paper [14] (Fig.\u00a02a, b, Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes). Cells that did not fall into these clusters were collectively assigned to an \u201cambiguous\u201d group, as done in the original paper. Next, to visualize the results, Giotto can create an interactive 3D plot for the whole dataset or specifically highlight one or more selected 2D slices (Fig.\u00a02c). Together with overlaying gene expression information (Fig.\u00a02d, e), such visualization enables the user to explore tissue structure and concomitant gene expression variation in a detailed manner.\nFig. 2Analysis and visualization of large-scale spatial transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. a Visualization in both expression (top) and physical (bottom) space of the cell types identified by Giotto Analyzer in the pre-optic hypothalamic merFISH dataset, which consists of 12 slices from the same 3D sample (distance unit\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u03bcm). b Heatmap showing the marker genes for the identified cell populations in a, c Visualization in both expression and physical space of two representative slices within the z-orientation (100\u2009\u03bcm and 400\u2009\u03bcm). d, e Overlay of gene expression in both expression and physical space for the selected slices in c, f. Visualization in both expression (top) and spatial (bottom) space of the clusters identified by Giotto Analyzer in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue-CyCIF dataset, which covers multiple tissues, including pancreas, small intestine, and cancer cells (distance unit\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u03bcm). g Heatmap showing the marker proteins for the identified cell clusters in f, h. Visualization in both expression and physical space of two selected windows (red squares in f) in the normal pancreas and small-intestinal regions. i, j Overlay of gene expression in both expression and physical space for the selected windows in hFull size imageIn a similar manner, we analyzed the mouse visual cortex STARmap (Additional file 1: Fig. S3 A-D) and mouse somatosensory cortex osmFISH (Additional file 1: Fig. S4 A-D) datasets (see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes for details). Both datasets show the typical anatomical multi-layered structure of the cortex. In the 3D STARmap analysis, we present an additional functionality that allows the user to create 2D virtual sections of a 3D sample (Additional file 1: Fig. S3 A, C and E), which could be useful for more refined structural analysis, as demonstrated in our analysis of the STARmap dataset (see section \u201cGiotto identifies distinct cellular neighborhoods and interactions\u201d and Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes for details).Due to the similarity of data structure, it is straightforward to apply Giotto to analyze large-scale spatial proteomic datasets such as CyCIF, CODEX, and MIBI (see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes for details). As an illustrating example, we analyzed a public dataset obtained by CyCIF [10]. The dataset profiled the spatial distribution of 21 proteins and 3 cellular compartment or organelle markers at single-cell resolution in a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) sample that spanned across three distinct tissues: the pancreas, small intestine, and tumor. In total, 160,000 cells were profiled. Giotto identified 13 coarse clusters which include mesenchymal, epithelial, immune, and cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02f, g). Next, we zoomed into each tissue to refine the cell type structure in the pancreas and small intestine separately (Fig.\u00a02h). For example, we can now see clearly that the pancreas is structured in distinct zones enriched with epithelial (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal or stromal (Vimentin) cells, respectively. On the other hand, the small intestine shows a clear proliferating zone (PCNA) and the activation of Wnt signaling (b-catenin) in intestinal epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02i, j). Both observations are consistent with the original paper [10]. Applying the same approach to analyze a mouse spleen dataset from CODEX [12] allowed us to identify zones enriched with CD8(+) T cells (Zone 1) and enriched with erythroblasts and F4/80 macrophages (Zone 2) (Additional file 1: Fig. S4 E-I). As such, the employment of Giotto to quickly zoom in to different regions is useful for uncovering the organization of spatial tissues or expression levels in a hierarchical manner.Analysis of data with lower spatial resolutionRecently, a number of lower-resolution spatial transcriptomic technologies have been developed, such as 10X Genomics Visium [26], Slide-seq [8], and DBiT-seq [27]. Despite their lower spatial resolution, these technologies are useful because they are currently more accessible. To overcome the challenge of lower resolution, Giotto implements a number of algorithms for estimating the enrichment of a cell type in different regions (Fig.\u00a03a). In this approach, a continuous value representing the likelihood of the presence of a cell type of interest is assigned to a spatial location which contains multiple cells. To this end, Giotto requires additional input representing the gene signatures of known cell types. Currently, the input gene signatures for the known cell types can either be provided by the user directly as cell type marker gene lists, or be automatically inferred by Giotto based on an additional scRNAseq data matrix input. Giotto then evaluates the match between each cell type\u2019s gene signatures and the expression pattern at each spatial location and reports an enrichment score by using one of the three algorithms: PAGE [28], RANK, and Hypergeometric testing (Fig.\u00a03a, see \u201cMethods\u201d for details). PAGE calculates an enrichment score based on the fold change of cell type marker genes for each spot. RANK does not require predefined marker genes but instead creates a full ranking of genes ordered by the cell-type specificity score in the scRNAseq data matrix, and computes a ranking-based statistic. Hypergeometric test computes a p value based on the overlap between each cell-type-specific marker gene set and the set of spot-specific genes, i.e., those that are expressed at significantly higher levels at certain spots than others (see \u201cMethods\u201d). As negative controls, enrichment scores are also calculated for scrambled spatial transcriptomic data. This allows us to evaluate the statistical significance of an observed enrichment score.\nFig. 3Cell-type enrichment analysis on spatial expression data. a Schematic of cell-type enrichment analysis pipeline. The inputs are spatial expression data and cell-type-specific gene signatures. These two sources of information are integrated to infer cell type enrichment scores. Giotto implements three methods for enrichment analysis: PAGE, RANK, and Hypergeometric. b Single-cell resolution seqFISH+ data are used to simulate coarse-resolution spatial transcriptomic data generated from spot-like squares by projecting onto a regular spatial grid (500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500 pixels). Colored squares indicate those that contain cells. External scRNAseq data are visualized by UMAP. c Comparison of cell-type enrichment scores (left, inferred by PAGE) and observed frequency of various cell types (right, based on seqFISH+ data). The agreement between the two is quantified by area under curve (AUC) scores (green circles). d Cell type enrichment analysis for the mouse Visium brain dataset (distance unit\u2009=\u20091 pixel, 1 pixel \u2248 1.46\u2009\u03bcm). Enrichment scores for selected cell types are displayed (top left) and compared with the expression level of known marker genes (bottom left). For comparison, a snapshot of the anatomic structure image obtained from mouse Allen Brain Atlas is displayed. Known locations for the selected cell types are highlightedFull size imageTo rigorously evaluate the performance of these cell-type enrichment algorithms, we created a simulated dataset based on the aforementioned seqFISH+ dataset, for which the cell type annotation has been established at the single-cell resolution. To mimic the effect of spatial barcoding, such as that being used in Visium, the merged fields of view were divided into spot-like squares from a regular spatial grid (500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500 pixels, ~\u200951.5\u2009\u03bcm) (Fig.\u00a03b). For cells located in each square, their gene expression profiles were averaged, thereby creating a new dataset with lower spatial resolution. To apply cell-type enrichment analysis, we obtained scRNAseq data and derived marker gene lists for somatosensory cortex associated cell types from a previous study [29]. To facilitate cross-platform comparison, we focused on the six major cell types that were annotated by both studies: astrocytes, microgila, endothelial mural, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and oligodendrocytes (Fig.\u00a03b). For each cell type, we assigned an enrichment score and p value for each spot by using one of the three enrichment analysis methods mentioned above (Fig.\u00a03c). To quantify the performance of each method, we evaluated the area under curve (AUC) score, which was obtained by using the ranking of enrichment score values to predict the presence of a cell type at each spot. Both PAGE and RANK provide high accuracy (median AUC\u2009=\u20090.95 and 0.96, respectively, Fig.\u00a03c, Additional file 1: Fig. S5 and S6A). Even if a spot contains only one cell from a given type, it can often be identified (47 out of 67, ~\u200970%). The only cell type that cannot be well predicted by this approach is inhibitory neurons, whose gene signatures are less distinct than others.In comparison, the hypergeometric test and Spearman correlation methods are less accurate (median AUC\u2009=\u20090.86 and 0.72, respectively, Additional file 1: Fig. S5 and S6A, Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes). We also compared it with RCTD [30], which is a newly developed method for deconvolution. RCTD also performed well (median AUC value of 0.95, Additional file 1: Fig. S5. and S6A), but it was considerably slower than the other methods (Additional file 1: Fig. S6C). The four methods that performed well were also robust to changes in number of transcripts (UMIs) (Additional file 1: Fig. S6B).Next, we applied cell-type enrichment analysis to a publicly available mouse brain Visium dataset (downloaded from https://www.10xgenomics.com/). Spatial transcriptomic information was obtained by using 2698 spatially barcoded array spots, each covering a circled area with 55\u2009\u03bcm in diameter. To comprehensively perform enrichment analysis, cell type annotations and corresponding gene signatures were obtained from a public scRNAseq dataset [31]. Here, we applied PAGE to identify the spatial patterns of the major cell taxonomies identified previously [31]. We found that a number of cell types are spatially restricted to distinct anatomical regions (Fig.\u00a03d, Additional file 1: Fig. S6D). The spatial patterns of the enrichment scores are consistent with the literature for a number of cell types, such as peptidergic cells, granule neurons, ependyma astrocytes, and medium spiny neurons (Fig.\u00a03d) [32,33,34]. Similar but less obvious trends can be observed by inspecting the expression pattern of specific marker genes (Fig.\u00a03d), which is consistent with the fact that cell types are typically defined by the concerted activities of multiple genes. Of note, the enrichment analysis also correctly predicted the absence of cell types that should not be present in the sample, such as cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and spinal cord cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S6D).To test the general applicability of the enrichment analysis algorithms, we re-analyzed a Slide-seq dataset [8] (see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes for details), where the read coverage is lower than Visium. This dataset profiles the mouse cerebellum, containing 21,000 beads and 10,500 genes at a coverage of 80 UMIs per bead. Cell-type gene signature information was obtained from a public scRNAseq dataset for a similar region [31]. Analysis of this scRNAseq dataset identified 15 different cell types. We applied the RANK method for enrichment analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A) and noticed distinct spatial enrichment of cell types in the Slide-seq data that are consistent with prior knowledge. For example, the Purkinje cells were correctly mapped to the Purkinje layer, granule cells were correctly mapped to the nuclear layer, and GABAergic interneurons were mapped to the molecular layer (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B). For comparison, we also applied RCTD to analyze the same dataset and obtained similar results (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B, C).Giotto uncovers different layers of spatial expression variabilityA key component of Giotto Analyzer is the implementation of a wide range of computational methods to identify spatial patterns based on gene expression. On a fundamental level, Giotto Analyzer represents the spatial relationship among different cells as a spatial grid or network (Fig.\u00a04a). To create a spatial grid, each image field is partitioned into regular squares and the gene expression patterns associated with cells within each square are averaged. As such, the spatial grid is a coarse-resolution representation of the data. A spatial network preserves single-cell resolution, and it is created by connecting neighboring cells through a Delaunay triangulation network (see \u201cMethods\u201d). As an alternative approach to create a spatial network, the user can create a spatial network by selecting the k-nearest neighbors or using a fixed distance cut-off, which allows the user to fine-tune the influence of neighboring cells in more downstream applications (Additional file 1: Fig. S8A). However, as shown in Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes, our analysis results are typically insensitive to the specific choice of parameter values.\nFig. 4Layers of spatial gene expression variability. a Schematic representation of the subsequent steps needed to dissect the different layers of spatial gene expression variability. The original cell locations, a spatial grid, or a spatial network is required to identify individual genes with spatial coherent expression patterns. Those spatial genes can then be used as input to compute continuous spatial co-expression patterns or to find discrete spatial domains with HMRF. b\u2013d Spatial gene expression analysis of the seqFISH+ somatosensory cortex dataset (distance unit\u2009=\u20091 pixel, 1 pixel \u2248 103\u2009nm). b Examples of identified spatial genes within the somatosensory multi-layered cortex.

Identified spatial co-expression modules are indicated with different colors on top. f Metagene visualizations for all the identified spatial gene co-expression modules from e, g Selected gene visualizations for each identified spatial metagene in e and fFull size imageA basic and often first important task in spatial transcriptomic or proteomic analysis is to identify genes whose expression displays a coherent spatial pattern. To this end, Giotto implements a number of methods, including SpatialDE [35], Trendsceek [36], SPARK [37], and two novel methods that are based on spatial network calculations. More specifically, the latter two methods are based on statistical enrichment of spatial network neighbors in the high gene expression state after binarization therefore named as BinSpect (Binary Spatial Extraction). The two methods, called BinSpect-kmeans and BinSpect-rank, respectively, differ in the way of binarization (Additional file 1: Fig. S8B, Methods). To evaluate the performance of these methods, we applied each to the seqFISH+ dataset, where many genes are expected to display layer-specific patterns that are consistent with the anatomical structure of the somatosensory cortex (Fig.\u00a04b, Additional file 1: Fig. S8C). For each method, we selected the top 1000 genes as candidates for spatially coherent genes. Of note, a large subset of these genes was identified by at least four of the methods (Fig.\u00a04c), these include previously established layer-specific genes such as Cux2, Grm2, and Rprm, indicating that genes with a known and strong spatially coherent expression pattern can be found in a robust manner. On the other hand, subsets of genes were detected by only one or a combination of specific method(s) (Additional file 1: Fig. S8D-G, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes), suggesting it may be beneficial to combine results from all methods for comprehensiveness. The main advantage of the BinSpect methods introduced here is that they are significantly faster compared to SpatialDE (~\u20096\u20138\u00d7), SPARK (~\u200929\u201345\u00d7), and Trendsceek (~\u2009816\u20133300\u00d7) (Additional file 1: Fig. S8H-I, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes).Next, to assess how effective each method could retrieve known spatial patterns, we performed a quantitative evaluation based on simulated patterns. In this evaluation, we excluded trendsceek since its speed inhibited its use in large-scale simulation studies. Since each method was based on different assumptions or statistical models, we established an unbiased simulation strategy based on real high-quality data (seqFISH+), which did not rely on a simplified and arbitrary representation of spatial expression data, but instead incorporated all known and unknown variability factors observed in a large subset of genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S9, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes for details). These results show that BinSpect (kmeans and rank) perform systematically better at retrieving known spatial genes, especially when additional noise is introduced. This observation is consistent irrespective of the spatial expression pattern that is evaluated (Additional file 1: Fig. S8J).Giotto implements two approaches to systematically summarize the spatial patterns of a large number of spatial genes (Fig.\u00a04a). First, Giotto identifies spatial domains with coherent gene expression patterns by implementing our recently developed hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model [38]. An HMRF model detects spatial domains by comparing the gene expression patterns of each cell with its neighborhood to search for coherent patterns (see \u201cMethods\u201d for details). The inference is based on the joint probability of the intrinsic factor (expression pattern of each cell) and the extrinsic factor (domain state distribution of the surrounding cells) [38]. The analysis starts with the identification of spatial genes using one of the previously described methods. Then we apply our HMRF model to infer the spatial domain state for each cell or spot. In applying HMRF to the seqFISH+ dataset, our analysis identified 9 distinct spatial domains that were consistent with the anatomic layer structure (Fig.\u00a04d). For example, Domain D7 is similar to Layer L1, and Domain D2 is similar to Layer L2/3. Of note, such layered structure is not completely reflected by the distribution of different cell types (Additional file 1: Fig. S1F), as numerous cell types (such as inhibitory neurons and endothelial cells) are distributed across multiple layers.In addition, Giotto also implements a summary view of spatial gene expression patterns based on co-expression analysis. As an illustrating example, we analyzed a Visium dataset obtained from the kidney coronal section, which has known and distinguishable anatomic structures [39, 40]. Using the BinSpect-kmeans algorithm in Giotto, we selected the top 500 spatially coherent genes. To identify spatial patterns, we created a co-expression matrix as follows. First, we spatially smoothed the gene expression data through spatial neighbor averaging, and then created co-expression modules by clustering the spatially smoothed data (Fig.\u00a04e). Next, the spatial pattern of each module was summarized by a metagene defined by averaging the expression of all associated genes, which were stored and visualized (Fig.\u00a04f). These spatial metagene profiles resemble the known anatomical structures of the mouse kidney and its surrounding environment, which is further corroborated by the spatial co-expressed genes in each module (see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes). Moreover, individual genes representing the co-expression patterns were easily extracted and displayed (Fig.\u00a04g), providing researchers the opportunity to explore these spatial co-expression patterns in an unbiased manner on a transcriptome wide level. In addition, Giotto also provides a co-expression network based on single-cell expression data so that users can further filter or distinguish spatial co-expression within a local neighborhood from co-expression within the same cell. Finally, these global co-expression patterns are largely insensitive to the characteristics of the underlying spatial network (Additional file 1: Fig. S10A-D, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes for details).Giotto identifies distinct cellular neighborhoods and interactionsMost cells reside within complex tissue structures, where they can communicate with their neighboring cells through specific molecules and signaling pathways. Hence, gene expression within each cell is likely driven by the combination of an intrinsic (cell-type-specific) component and an extrinsic component mediated by cell-cell communications (Fig.\u00a05a). Giotto Analyzer provides a number of tools to explore and extract information related to the cell neighborhood organization, cell-cell communication, and the effect of neighboring cell types on gene expression. To identify distinct cell-type/cell-type interacting patterns, Giotto evaluates the enrichment of the frequency that each pair of cell types is proximal to each other. When analyzing the seqFISH+ somatosensory cortex data, we observed that layer-specific neurons usually interact with each other, which agrees with the known multi-layered organization of the cortex (Fig.\u00a05b). Such homo-typic (same cell types) relationships are in agreement with what has been observed by others, including in other tissues [12, 41]. Here we also notice that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, L2/3 and L4 excitatory neurons, and L5 and L6 excitatory neurons form frequent hetero-typic (two different cell types) interactions. This is again in line with the expected anatomical structure of the cortex, due to positioning of the cortex layers and the increased presence of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes close to where they originate in the subventrical zone (Additional file 1: Fig. S1F and Additional file 3: Fig.\u00a03F). These observations are robust to changes in number of spatial neighbors (k) (Additional file 1: Fig. S11A, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes) and are furthermore observed in both the seqFISH+ and osmFISH somatosensory cortex datasets (Additional file 1: Fig. S11B, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes).\nFig. 5Cell neighborhood and cell-to-cell communication analyses. a Schematic of a multicellular tissue with an organized cellular structure (left) and environment specific gene expression (right). b A network representation of the pairwise interacting cell types identified by Giotto in the seqFISH+ somatosensory cortex dataset. Enriched or depleted interactions are depicted in red and green, respectively. Width of the edges indicates the strength of enrichment or depletion. c Visualization of the cell-to-cell communication analysis strategy. For each ligand-receptor pair from a known database a combined co-expression score was calculated for all cells of two interacting cell types (e.g., yellow and blue cells, left). This co-expression score was compared with a background distribution of co-expression scores based on spatial permutations (n\u2009=\u20091000). A cell-cell communication score based on adjusted p value and log2 fold change was used to rank a ligand-receptor pair across all identified cells of interacting cell types (right). d Heatmap (left) showing the ranking results for the ligand-receptor analysis as in c (y-axis) versus the same analysis but without spatial information (x-axis) for all the ligand-receptor pairs.

Over 200,000 cells from 41 patients were analyzed together to generate over 20 cell populations (Additional file 1: Fig. S12A). Of note, the preferred mode of hetero-typic cell-type interactions is highly patient specific (Additional file 1: Fig. S12B, C). For example, in patients 4 and 5, the Keratin-marked epithelial cells and immune cells are well segregated from each other, whereas patients 10 and 17 feature a rather mixed environment between T cells, Keratin, and Ki67 cancer cells. (Additional file 1: Fig. S12B, C). These observations are consistent with prior findings [13].Giotto builds further on the concept of interacting cell types and aims to identify which known ligand-receptor pairs show increased or decreased co-expression, as a reasonable proxy for activity, in two cell types that spatially interact with each other (Fig.\u00a05c). By creating a background distribution through spatially aware permutations (see \u201cMethods\u201d), Giotto can identify which ligand-receptor pairs are potentially more or less active when cells from two cell types are spatially adjacent to each other. By comparing with a spatially unaware permutation method, similar as previously done [42], we can see that the predictive power is limited without spatial information (AUC\u2009=\u20090.43) (Fig.\u00a05c,d). This analysis is relatively stable to different numbers of spatial neighbors (k) within the spatial network (Additional file 1: Fig. S11C, see Additional file 3: Supplementary Notes) and is observed for multiple ligand-receptor pairs spread out over multiple cell type pairs (Fig.\u00a05e). Two potential examples of increased co-expression of a ligand-receptor pair are seen in spatially interacting astrocytes and Lhx6+ inhibitory neurons displaying increased expression of Ddr2-Col1a1 and Bmp6-Bmpr1b in corresponding endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes, respectively (Fig.\u00a05f).More generally, Giotto implements a number of statistical tests (t-test, limma, Wilcoxon, and a spatial permutation test) to identify genes whose expression level variation within a cell type is significantly associated with an interacting cell type (see \u201cMethods\u201d). After correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, we identified 73 such genes (|log2 FC|\u2009>\u20092 and FDR\u2009<\u20090.1), which we refer to as the interaction changed genes (ICGs). These ICGs are distributed among different interacting cell type pairs (Additional file 1: Fig. S11D). For example, we noticed that endothelial cells interacting with Lhx6 iNeuron were associated with increased expression of Jakmip1 and Golgb1, whereas both Dact2 and Ddx27 expression levels were increased in cells from the same cell type but interacting with L4 eNeurons (Fig.\u00a05g). On the opposite direction, interaction with astrocytes was associated with decreased expression of Abl1 and Zswim8. Of note, all these subsets of endothelial cells do not show any difference in expression of their known marker genes, such as Pltp, Cldn5, and Apcdd1 (Fig.\u00a05g, Additional file 1: Fig. S2D).Giotto Viewer: interactive visualization and exploration of spatial transcriptomic dataGiotto Viewer is designed for interactive visualization and exploration of spatial transcriptomic data. Compared to the figure outputs from Giotto Analyzer, the objective of Giotto Viewer is to provide an interactive and user-friendly workspace where the user can easily explore the data and integrate the results from various analyses from Giotto Analyzer, and further incorporate additional information that cannot be easily quantified, such as cell staining images.Giotto Viewer is a web-based application running in a local environment. It supports a multi-panel view of the spatial expression data. Each panel can be configured to display either the cells in physical or the expression space and overlays gene expression information on top. Complex geometries such as the 2D cell morphology and the associated large antibody staining images of the cells can be toggled easily within each panel. We use a Google Map-like algorithm to facilitate efficient navigation of large data (in terms of either images or cell numbers, see \u201cMethods\u201d). Importantly, panels are interlinked and interactive through sharing of cell ID and annotation information (see \u201cMethods\u201d). This allows seamless integration of different views and facilitates synchronous updates across all panels. We were able to apply Giotto Viewer to display over 500,000 data points (or mRNA transcripts) within a group of cells on one screen without any problem. Indicating the Giotto viewer is capable of handling large datasets.As an illustrating example, we used Giotto Viewer to visualize the Visium brain dataset. By default, Giotto Viewer creates two panels, representing the data in physical and gene expression space, respectively (Fig.\u00a06a, left). Any property that is contained in a Giotto object, such as gene expression levels, spatial cell-type enrichment values, cell-type or spatial domain annotations, can be selected for visualization. Additional imaging-related information, such as cell staining and segmentation, can also be overlaid. The size and location of field of view can be easily adjusted via the zoom and pan functions. At one end of the spectrum, the image content at each single spot can be visualized (Fig.\u00a06a, right), revealing the underlying H&E staining pattern. An animated video is provided to illustrate how the user can interactively explore the data and high-level annotations (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Supplementary Video).\nFig. 6Giotto Viewer provides an interactive workspace to visualize and compare multiple cell annotations. a Visualization of the Visium brain dataset.

Supplementary video demonstrating the usage and options of Giotto Viewer.\nTo demonstrate the utility of Giotto Viewer for exploring and integrating a large amount of information generated by Giotto Analyzer, we used the aforementioned seqFISH+ dataset again. Through the analysis described above, we identified various annotations such as cell types, spatially coherent genes, and spatial domains. Therefore, it is of interest to compare the cell type and spatial domain annotation to investigate their relationship. To this end, we created four interlinked panels corresponding to cell type and spatial domain annotations represented in the physical and expression space, respectively (Fig.\u00a06b). The view of these panels can be synchronously updated through zoom and pan operations, enabling the user to easily explore the data and inspect any area of interest as desired. For example, as the user zooms in to the L1\u2013L2/3 region (Fig.\u00a06c), it becomes apparent that domain D7 consists of a mixture of cell types including astrocytes, microglias, and interneurons. Giotto Viewer also provides a lasso tool that allows users to select cells of interest for further analyses. The borders of the selected cells are highlighted and can be easily traced across different panels. As an example, cells from domain D7 are selected and highlighted (Fig.\u00a06c). By inspecting the pattern in the interlinked panels, it becomes obvious that this domain contains cells from multiple cell types. As such, both cell type and spatial domain differences contribute to cellular heterogeneity.To gain further insights into the difference between cell type and spatial domain annotations, we saved the selected cells to an output file. The corresponding information was directly loaded into Giotto Analyzer for further analysis. This allowed us to identify a number of additional marker genes, such as Cacng3 and Scg3 (Fig.\u00a06d). The seamless iteration between data analysis and visualization is a unique strength of Giotto.In addition, Giotto Viewer also provides the functionality to explore subcellular transcript or protein localization patterns. As an example, we used Giotto Viewer to visualize the exact locations of individual transcripts in selected cells from the seqFISH+ dataset (Fig.\u00a06e, Additional file 1: Fig. S12). To facilitate real-time exploration of the transcript localization data, which is much larger than other data components, we adopted a position-based caching of transcriptomic data (see \u201cMethods\u201d). From the original staining image (Additional file 1: Fig. S13A), the users can zoom in on any specific region or select specific cells and visualize the locations of either all detected transcripts (Additional file 1: Fig. S13B) or selected genes of interest (Additional file 1: Fig. S13C). The spatial extent of all transcripts is useful for cell morphology analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S13B), whereas the localization pattern of individual genes may provide functional insights into the corresponding genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S13C). For example, transcripts of Snrnp70 and Car10 are preferentially localized to the cell nucleus (delineated by DAPI background), while Agap2 and Kif5a transcripts are distributed closer to the cell periphery (Additional file 1: Fig. S13C).DiscussionSingle-cell analysis has entered a new phase\u2014from characterizing cellular heterogeneity to interpreting the role of spatial organization. To overcome the challenge for data analysis and visualization, we have developed Giotto as a standardized toolbox, which implements a rich set of algorithms to address the common tasks for spatial transcriptomics/proteomic data analysis, including cell-type enrichment analysis, spatially coherent gene detection, spatial pattern recognition, and cell neighborhood and interaction analyses. Through analyzing diverse public datasets, we have demonstrated that Giotto can be broadly applied in conjunction with a wide range of spatial transcriptomic and proteomic technologies.Giotto has a number of strengths, including modularization, interactive visualization, reproducibility, robustness, and flexibility. It differs from existing spatial data analysis and/or visualization pipelines [8, 35, 36, 38, 43,44,45,46] and is complementary to alternative strategies that computationally infer spatial information from single-cell RNAseq analysis [47]. To our knowledge, Giotto is the first demonstrated general-purpose toolbox for spatial transcriptomic/proteomic data analysis, while the other methods are designed for specific data types [44, 48,49,50] or tasks, such as the identification of cell types [43], marker genes [35, 36], or domain patterns [38]. Although both Seurat and Scanpy have now adopted spatial transcriptomic analysis functionalities, an important distinction is that our design of the Giotto object is specifically targeted for spatial transcriptomic data analysis, whereas the data structure in the other packages were originally designed for single-cell RNAseq analysis. The flexible design of Giotto makes it an ideal platform for incepting new algorithms. In addition, Giotto provides a convenient venue to integrate external information such as single-cell RNAseq data. As single-cell multi-omics data become more available, such integration may greatly enhance mechanistic understanding of the cell-state variation in development and diseases.MethodsGiotto analyzerGiotto Analyzer is an open-source R package that at its center creates a S4 Giotto object (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A), which stores a gene expression matrix, the accompanying cell locations, and optionally any associated tissue images for visualization purposes. It contains multiple functions that can either extract or add new information to this object in a flexible manner. In this way users can either follow the default settings or build their own stepwise pipeline to extract and visualize spatial information. In the next part, the core steps and functions of Giotto Analyzer are explained and names of functions are depicted in italic.Quality control, pre-processing, and normalizationA Giotto object can be created with the function createGiottoObject, which requires as minimum input an expression matrix and the spatial coordinates of corresponding cell centroids. If a dataset is composed of multiple fields of view or tiles, they can be stitched together by using stitchFieldCoordinates or stitchTileCoordinates, respectively. Next, this Giotto object can be filtered with filterGiotto to exclude low-quality cells or lowly expressed or detected genes. As a guide for setting the filtering parameters, the cell and gene distributions can be viewed with filterDistributions and the effect of multiple parameters can be tested with filterCombinations. Raw counts can further be normalized with normalizeGiotto, which can adjust for library size, log transform the matrix, and/or perform rescaling. Next the function addStatistics computes general cell and gene statistics such as the total number of detected genes and counts per cell. To adjust for variation due to the former technical covariates the adjustGiottoMatrix can be applied to the normalized data. If the dataset does not have single-cell resolution, the above steps can still proceed while treating each spatially barcoded spot as a cell.Feature selectionTo identify informative genes for clustering the calculateHVG can be used. Highly variable genes can be detected in two different manners. In the first method, all genes are divided in a predefined number (default\u2009=\u200920) of equal sized bins based on their expression. Within each bin the coefficient of variation for each gene is calculated and these are subsequently converted to z-scores. Genes above a predefined z-score threshold (default\u2009=\u20091.5) are selected for further analysis. For the second method, a loess regression model is calculated to predict the coefficient of variation based on the log-normalized expression values. Genes that show higher degree of variability than predicted are considered highly variable genes. Genes can be further filtered based on average expression values or detection percentage, which is returned by the addStatistics function.Dimensionality reductionTo reduce dimensions of the expression dataset users can perform principal component analysis (PCA) with runPCA. Significant PCs can be estimated with the signPCA function using a scree plot or the jackstraw method [51]. Further nonlinear dimension reduction can be performed with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [20] and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [19] directly on the expression matrix or on the PCA space using runUMAP and runtSNE, respectively.ClusteringFirst a shared or k-nearest neighbor (sNN or kNN) network needs to be constructed with createNearestNetwork which uses as input either processed expression values or their projection onto a selected dimension reduction space, such as that obtained from PCA. Louvain and Leiden clustering [22] are implemented as doLouvainCluster and doLeidenCluster and can be directly applied on the created expression-based network. Further subclustering on all or a selected set of clusters can be performed in an analogous manner with doLouvainSubCluster or doLeidenSubCluster. Alternative clustering options such as kmeans and hierarchical clustering are also available as doKmeans and doHclust. To aid in further fine-tuning, the clustering results users can compute cluster correlation scores with getClusterSimilarity and decide to merge clusters with mergeClusters based on a user defined correlation threshold and cluster size parameters.Marker gene detectionGiotto provides 3 different ways within the function findMarkers to identify marker genes for one or more clusters: scran, mast, and gini. The first two methods have been previously published [24, 52] and are implemented as findScranMarkers and findMastMarkers. In addition, we also developed a novel method based on the Gini-coefficient [25] and implemented it as findGiniMarkers, as schematically illustrated in Additional file 1: Fig. S2B. First, we calculate the average log-normalized expression for each gene in each cluster and represent the result as a matrix X, with X(i, j) representing the average expression of ith gene in jth cluster. Similarly, we calculate the detection fraction of each gene in each cluster and represent the result as a matrix Y, with Y(i, j) representing the detection fraction of ith gene in jth cluster. For each gene i, we calculate two related quantities Gexpr(i) and Gdet(i), by computing the Gini-coefficient associated with row X(i,.) and Y(i,.), respectively. Gini-coefficient of a vector x\u2009=\u2009[x1,x2, \u2026, xn] is defined as:\n G(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n{\\sum}_{j=1}^n\\mid {x}_i-{x}_j\\mid }{2\\ {n}^2\\ \\overline{x}} \nIn the meantime, for each gene i, we also rank the clusters based on either gene expression X(i,.) or detection rate Y(i,.), and the corresponding ranks are denoted by Rexpr(i,.) and Rdet(i,.), respectively. The ranks are subsequently rescaled between 0.1 and 1. Finally, an aggregated score Gfinal(i, j) is defined as follows:\n {G}_{\\mathrm{final}}\\left(i,j\\right)={G}_{\\mathrm{expr}}(i)\\times {G}_{\\mathrm{det}}(i)\\times {R}_{\\mathrm{expr}}\\left(i,j\\right)\\times {R}_{\\mathrm{det}}\\left(i,j\\right) \nThe marker genes associated with a cluster j are then identified as those with top values of Gfinal(., j). We have found this to be a fast and simple approach for effectively identifying genes that are both specific and sufficiently expressed in a particular cluster. In addition, an automated version to perform systematic pairwise comparisons between each cluster and all other clusters is also implemented as findMarkers_one_vs_all.Enrichment analysis of spatial expression dataThree enrichment methods are implemented into Giotto for enrichment analysis:Enrichment analysis by using PAGE (Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment) [28]In this method, a known set of m cell-type-specific marker genes is used as input. The objective is to evaluate if these genes are more highly expressed at each spot as compared to other spots. Specifically, for each spot, we define an enrichment score corresponding to a set of marker genes as follows. First, for each gene in the entire genome, we calculate the expression fold change of this gene by using the expression value in this spot versus the mean expression of all spots. Genes associated with high fold change values are annotated as spot-specific genes. The mean and standard deviation of these fold change values are denoted by \u03bc and \u03b4, respectively. For comparison, we also calculated the mean fold change associated with the set of marker genes, denoted by Sm. The enrichment score (ES) is then defined as follows:\n \\mathrm{ES}=\\frac{\\left({S}_m-\\mu \\right)\\times \\sqrt{m}}{\\delta } \nA higher ES value indicates a cell type is more likely to be associated with the spot in question. To estimate the null distribution, we repeat the analysis by using 1000 random gene sets with the same size. The resulting values are fit by a normal distribution. This null distribution is used to derive p values associated with the enrichment scores for the real data. The PAGE algorithm is implemented as runPAGEEnrich.Enrichment analysis based on rank of gene expressionIn this method, a known list of marker genes is not required. Instead, an external single-cell RNAseq dataset is used as input along with the cell-type annotation for each cell. A schematic of this method is illustrated in Additional file 1: Fig. S7A. The scRNAseq data matrix is used as input to define cell-type-specific gene signatures. A fold-change gene ranking is computed for each cell type (scRNAseq) and a relative gene ranking is computed for each spot or bead (Slide-seq is indicated here as an example), which is then used to derive enrichment scores. More precisely, Giotto automatically identifies cell-type-specific gene signatures (makeSignMatrixRank) by computing the fold change for each gene, g, defined as the ratio between its mean expression level within a cell type and the mean level across all cell types, followed by evaluating its relative rank R1g among all genes. In the meantime, genes are also ranked based on location specificity, R2g, using the spatial expression data. This is obtained by calculating the fold change comparing its expression level at a specific spot versus the overall mean and then ranking the results. The mutual rank [53] of gene g is then computed as\n {R}_g=\\sqrt{R{1}_g\\times R{2}_g} \nwhich is then converted to a rank-biased precision (RBP) score [54], which is defined as follows:\n \\mathrm{RB}{\\mathrm{P}}_g=\\left(1-p\\right)\\times {p}^{\\left({R}_g-1\\right)} \nwhere p is a constant set at 0.99. Intuitively, the RBP score is used to select genes that are highly ranked in terms of both cell-type specificity and location specificity. The tuning parameter p in the above equation is introduced to control the relative weight of highly ranked genes. In the end, the enrichment score (ES) is determined by the sum of genes with top-ranked RBP scores:\n \\mathrm{ES}=\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{100}{\\mathrm{RBP}}_k The RANK method is implemented as the runRankEnrich function. To estimate the null distribution, we randomly shuffle the ranking of genes in the scRNAseq dataset for 1000 times of each cell type and then apply the above analysis to the shuffled data. The resulting values are fit by a gamma distribution, using the \u201cfitdistrplus\u201d package in R. This null distribution is used to derive p values associated with the enrichment scores for the real data.Enrichment analysis by using hypergeometric distributionThis method also requires a known set of m cell-type-specific marker genes as input, but it evaluates enrichment by simply using a hypergeometric test. A contingency table is constructed by dividing all genes into four non-overlapping categories, based on marker gene annotation and binarization of gene expression values. The latter is determined by top 5% expression genes for each spot. Based on this contingency table, a p value is calculated. Here the enrichment score is defined as \u2212log10 (p value).Simulation analysis of seqFISH+ dataWe coarse grain seqFISH+ dataset to simulate spatial expression data of a multiple cellular level. The dataset is gridded by 500 pixels by 500 pixels (~\u200951.5\u2009\u03bcm) length (Fig.\u00a03b). This length is quite similar with the diameter of spots from Visium spatial expression dataset (55\u2009\u03bcm). Then the gene expression for each grid is calculated as the sum of normalized single-cell expressions within the grid. After normalization of gene expression for coarse-gridded data, we perform enrichment analysis by using somatosensory cortex single-cell RNAseq data from [29] (GSE60361). scRNAseq data is normalized by normalizeGiotto using Giotto. Marker genes for each cell type are identified by using findMarkers_one_vs_all with parameter: method\u2009=\u2009\u201cscran\u201d, expression_values\u2009=\u2009\u201cnormalized\u201d. We then intersect those marker genes with genes in seqFISH+ data. Top 100 intersect marker genes for each cell type are kept for further enrichment analysis.To match the cell-type annotations between seqFISH+ and scRNAseq data, we aggregated the major clusters annotated by Giotto pipeline. \u201cL2/3 eNeuron,\u201d \u201cL4 eNeuron,\u201d \u201cL5 eNeuron,\u201d and \u201cL6 eNeuron\u201d were marked as excitatory neuron (eNeuron). \u201cAdarb2 iNeuron\u201d and \u201cLhx6 iNeuron\u201d were marked as inhibitory neurons (iNeuron). \u201cEndothelial\u201d and \u201cmural\u201d were marked as \u201cendothelial_mural\u201d. The percentage of cell type for each grid was calculated to evaluate the performance of enrichment methods. Top 100 marker genes identified were used for PAGE and hypergeometric analysis by createSpatialEnrich with parameters: enrich_method\u2009=\u2009\u201cPAGE\u201d and enrich_method\u2009=\u2009\u201chypergeometric,\u201d respectively. The single-cell expression matrix as well as cell labels were used for rank matrix generation by using makeSignMatrixRank with default parameters and enrichment analysis by using createSpatialEnrich with parameter: enrich_method\u2009=\u2009\u201crank.\u201dSpatial grid and neighborhood networkA spatial grid is defined as a Cartesian coordinate system with defined units of width and height and is created with the function createSpatialGrid. The gene expression levels of cells within each grid box are averaged. Another representation of the spatial relationship is the spatial neighborhood network (Fig.\u00a04a), where each node represents a cell, and each pair of neighboring cells is connected through an edge. The number of neighbors can be defined by setting (a minimal) k and/or radial distance from the centroid position of each cell, and the edge weights can be either binary or continuous. Alternatively, a Delaunay network can be created, which does not require k or radial distance to be specified and is based on Delaunay triangulation. The Delaunay triangulation and its related concept of Voronoi Tessellation was previously applied to study species distribution in the field of eco-geography with the goal to partition a space according to certain neighborhood relations of a given set of points (e.g., cells) in this space. It has been used and adopted in various fields of biology, including to analyze tissue distribution at the single-cell level [12].Spatially coherent gene detectionIn total, Giotto currently has five different methods to identify spatial coherent gene expression patterns. Three previously published methods SpatialDE [35], Trendsceek [36], and SPARK [37] can be run with the functions spatialDE, trendSceek, and spark. The two new methods introduced here are based on statistical enrichment of binarized expression data in neighboring cells within the spatial network, as schematically illustrated in Additional file 1: Fig. S8B. First, for each gene, expression values are binarized using kmeans clustering (k\u2009=\u20092) or simple thresholding on rank (default\u2009=\u200930%), which is the only difference between these two methods. Next, a contingency table is calculated based on the binarized expression values between neighboring cells and used as input for a Fisher exact test to obtain an odds ratio estimate and p value. In this way, a gene is considered a spatial gene if it is usually found to be highly expressed in proximal or neighboring cells. In addition to the odds ratio and p value for each gene, the average gene expression, the number of highly expressing cells, and the number of hub cells are computed and provided. A hub cell is considered a cell with high expression of a gene of interest and which has multiple high expressing neighboring cells of that gene. These features can be used by the user to further rank and explore spatial genes with different characteristics. We have named the latter method BinSpect (Binary Spatial extract) and implemented it as binSpect, within this function the user can choose to use kmeans or threshold ranking to binarize the expression matrix.Spatial pattern simulation dataOur strategy for simulating spatial patterns is schematically illustrated in Additional file 1: Fig. S9. To generate known spatial patterns based on real spatial data, we first randomly select a large number of genes (n\u2009=\u2009100) from the seqFISH+ dataset, each with their own unique expression distribution, drop-outs, expression levels, and other unknown factors of variation. We then create a fixed spatial pattern, ordered the cells according to their gene expression levels, and created two groups. One group (group G) contains all the highest expressing cells and is equal to the size of the spatial pattern and another group (group R) contains all the other remaining cells. Cells within group G are given a probability Pr, while cells in group R are given the probability 1\u2009\u2212\u2009Pr. This probability is then used to randomly assign each cell to the fixed pattern, such that with Pr\u2009=\u20091 all the highest expressing cells are being randomly positioned into the spatial pattern, while with Pr\u2009=\u20090.5 this process is completely random. This assignment is repeated multiple times (n\u2009=\u20096) so that a distribution is obtained for a range of probability levels Pr\u2009=\u2009{0.5, 0.65. 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 1}. Thus, for each pattern, we create 4200 simulations (100 genes \u00d7 7 probability levels \u00d7 6 random samples). This analysis is carried out using the function runPatternSimulation.Spatial co-expression patternsTo identify robust patterns of co-expressed spatial genes the functions detectSpatialCorGenes and clusterSpatialCorGenes can be used on the identified individual spatial genes. The first function spatially smooths gene expression through a grid averaging or k-nearest neighbor approach and then calculates the gene-to-gene correlation (default\u2009=\u2009Pearson) scores. In addition, it also calculates gene-to-gene correlation within the original single cells to distinguish between spatial and cell intrinsic correlation. The second function performs hierarchical clustering to cluster the gene-to-gene co-expression network into modules and creates metagene scores by averaging all the genes for each identified co-expression module, which can subsequently be viewed using the standard viewing options provided in Giotto.Spatial domain detectionSpatial domains are identified with a hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model as previously described [38]. In brief, HMRF is a graph-based model that infers the state of each cell as the joint probability of the cell\u2019s intrinsic state (inferred from the cell\u2019s own gene expression vector), and the cell\u2019s extrinsic state, which is based on the distribution of the states of the cell\u2019s neighbors. The notion of state is the spatial domain in our case. The neighborhood graph defines the extent of the neighbor cell influence, together with the parameter beta that defines the strength of the interaction of cells. At the end, HMRF assigns each cell to one of k spatial domains (k to be defined by the user). This HMRF model is implemented in Python and incorporated in Giotto by using the consecutive wrapper functions doHMRF, viewHMRF, and addHMRF to discover, visualize, and select HMRF domain annotations respectively.Identification of proximal or interacting cell typesTo identify cell types that are found to be preferentially located in a spatially proximal manner, as a proxy for potential cell-cell interactions, we use a random permutation (default n\u2009=\u20091000) strategy of the cell type labels within a defined spatial network. First, we label the edges of the spatial network as homo- or hetero-typic, if they connect cells of identical or different annotated cell types, respectively. Then we determine the ratio of observed-over-expected frequencies between two cell types, where the expected frequencies are calculated from the permutations. Associated p values are calculated by observing how often the observed value were higher or lower than the simulated values for respectively increased or decreased frequencies. A wrapper for this analysis is implemented in Giotto Analyzer as cellProximityEnrichment.Gene expression changes within cellular neighborhoodSpatially informed ligand-receptor pairingTo investigate how cells communicate within their microenvironment, Giotto can incorporate known ligand-receptor information from existing databases [55]. By calculating the increased spatial co-expression of such gene pairs in neighboring cells from two cell types, it estimates which ligand-receptor pairs might be used more (or less) for communication between interacting cells from two cell types. This is implemented in the function spatCellCellcom, which is short for spatially informed cell-to-cell communication. More specifically, for each ligand-receptor pair, a cell-cell-communication score S is calculated for every pair of cell types. In particular, for ligand L, receptor R, cell type A, and cell type B, S(L,R,A,B) is defined as the weighted average expression of R and L in all the interacting A and Bs, or in other words in the subset of A and B cells that are proximal to each other (based on spatial network).\n \\overline{S\\left(L,R,A,B\\right)}=\\frac{1}{n}{\\sum}_{i=1}^n{L}_i+\\frac{1}{m}{\\sum}_{j=1}^m{R}_j; \nwhere n represents the number of A-type cells that interact with B-type cells, m represents the number of B-type cells that interact with A-type cells, Li represents the expression level of the ligand in the ith A-type cell, and Rj represents the expression level of the receptor in the jth B-type cell. Next, to assess if the calculated score S is statistically significant, a random null distribution is computed. This background distribution is created by shuffling cell locations within the same cell type for A and B for 1000 (= default) times. In each round, a permutation score Sp is calculated using the same formula. Associated p values were calculated as the probability of Sp to be greater or smaller than the actual observed score S. The p values for all ligand-receptor pairs in all cell-type pairs were subsequently adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. A final differential activity score was calculated by multiplying the log2 fold change with the adjusted p values. The ligand-receptor pair information was retrieved from FANTOM5 [55].Expression-informed ligand-receptor pairingThis analysis can be performed with exprCellCellcom, short for expression-informed cell-to-cell communication, and is analogous to the method for \u201cspatially informed ligand-receptor pairing\u201d (described above) except that no spatial information is used. This means that ligand-receptor expression levels are calculated for all cells from two cell types and that the background null distribution is similarly computed by reshuffling all cell labels. This approach is used to mimic scRNAseq-based analysis.Comparison between spatially and expression-informed ligand-receptor pairingWe perform a direct comparison between expression-informed ligand-receptor pairing (with the function exprCellCellcom) and spatially informed ligand-receptor pairing (with the function spatCellCellcom). For both analyses, we rank all ligand-receptor pairs according to their interaction-induced expression changes in all pairs of cell types. This means that for spatCellCellcom, we use the cells from two cell types that proximally interact (based on the spatial network), and for exprCellCellcom, we use all cells from two cell types. Next, we compute the AUC to examine how efficient the expression ranked ligand-receptor pairs can predict the top-ranked spatially informed ligand-receptor pair.Cell-type interaction mediated gene expression changesTo identify all potential gene expression changes associated with specific cell-type interactions in an unbiased manner, Giotto implements 4 differential expression tests to identify such interaction changed genes (ICG), including t-test, limma test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and spatial permutation test. For each cell type, we divide the annotated cells into two complementary subgroups, with one containing the subset which neighbor cells from another specific cell type. Differentially expressed genes between these groups are identified by using each of the statistical tests mentioned above. To adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, a background null distribution is created by reshuffling the cells within the same cell type. This analysis is implemented as the function findInteractionChangedGenes or the shorter version findICG. Additional filtering can be achieved by using filterInteractionChangedGenes or filterICG in order to reduce errors due to low (interacting) cell number, fold change or absolute expression differences.Giotto viewerGiotto Viewer is a web-based application that can be installed on any Linux-, Windows-, or MAC OS-based computer. The Giotto Viewer canvas consists of a cell object layer, containing all the differently shaped cells, an image layer corresponding to staining images, and an annotation property layer that specifies the cluster membership and gene expression information. Below is a setup overview:Input filesThe minimal input files for Giotto Viewer contain the gene expression matrix and the cell centroid spatial coordinates. Such information can be either provided manually in tabular format, or directly loaded through the output files of Giotto Analyzer. If available, additional input files such as cell segmentations (ROI files), staining images (TIFF files), and transcript locations (TXT files) can also be incorporated. Giotto Viewer provides tools to process such information for visualization (see next sections).To streamline setup, we provide guidelines for setting up various platforms.\n\n\n(i)\nSeqFISH/MerFISH: this applies to SeqFISH/merFISH where multi-field imaging data, transcript locations, and cell segmentations are available. Giotto Viewer first extracts multi-channel images (where a channel may correspond to Nissl, DAPI, polyA) from TIFF using ImageMagick library (https://imagemagick.org/). Images within the same channel are then stitched. For stitching, Giotto provides an option to stitch images across multiple fields of view (FOV) with gaps in between. The layout can be manually controlled by modifying a coordinate offset file specifying the relative positions of FOVs. To automate these various actions, an initial setup is done using \u201cgiotto_setup_image --require-stitch=y --image=y --image-multi-channel=y --segmentation=y --multi-fov=y --output-json=step1.json\u201d which creates a template that sets up the sequence of tasks to be performed. Details of the template such as specifying the image file, the stitch offset file, and tiling are next achieved through \u201cgiotto_step1_modify_json\u201d script. Lastly, sequence of tasks is performed through \u201csmfish_step1_setup\u201d. An overview of the Giotto Viewer processing steps is in Additional file 1: Fig. S14.\nCell boundary segmentation is a necessary step for assignment of each transcript to its corresponding cells. However, this task is highly dependent on the specific technology platform therefore not implemented in Giotto. On the other hand, Giotto Viewer can accept user-provided cell boundary segmentation information as input, in the form of Region-of-Interest (ROI) files, for visualization. Giotto Viewer extracts information from the ROI files by adapting a JAVA program based on the ImageJ framework.\nThe next step is tiling the stitched staining image. The purpose of tiling is to support a Google Maps-like algorithm to facilitate multi-level zooming and navigation. Conceptually, this is achieved by tiling of the large image to smaller chunks at various zoom levels to efficiently display a very large image (our stitched image frequently exceeds several hundred megabytes). This is implemented in Giotto Viewer by using the tileup package in Ruby (https://github.com/rktjmp/tileup). This creates a set of tiled images corresponding to 6 zoom levels with 1.5\u00d7 increment. The size of each tile is fixed at 256 by 256 pixels.\n\n\n\n(ii)\nFor the Visium platform with an accompanying image, the highest resolution raw H&E staining image is first padded to be square dimension. Next, a template is setup: \u201cgiotto_setup_image --require-stitch=n --image=y --image-multi-channel=n --segmentation=n --multi-fov=n --output-json=step1.json\u201d. The next two steps \u201cgiotto_step1_modify_json\u201d and \u201csmfish_step1_setup\u201d are proceeded as usual.\n\n\n(iii)\nOther platforms with no image nor cell segmentations (e.g., Slide-seq). We run \u201cgiotto_setup_image --require-stitch=n --image=n --image-multi-channel=n --segmentation=n --multi-fov=n --output-json=step1.json\u201d, followed by the subsequent two steps (described in ii). Giotto Viewer renders cells as circles in the physical space, and there is not an image background overlay.\n\nPanelsGiotto Viewer supports a multi-panel view configuration, which means that users can load and visualize any number of panels simultaneously (default number\u2009=\u20092), and add different types of data to each panel. To permit flexibility, there are four types of panels implemented in the Giotto Viewer: PanelTsne, PanelPhysical, and PanelPhysicalSimple, PanelPhysical10X. PanelTsne requires cell coordinates in the expression space as input. PanelPhysical lays out the cells in the physical space in the segmented cell shapes. PanelPhysicalSimple is a simplified version of PanelPhysical except that cell segmentation and staining images are not required, and instead renders cell objects as fixed size circle markers. PanelPhysical10X is unique to Visium in that it also registers the spot-level details of the Visium platform. The number of panels and the panel types can be specified, for example, through: \u201cgiotto_setup_viewer --num-panel=2 --input-preprocess-json=step1.json --panel-1=PanelPhysical10X --panel-2=PanelTsne --output-json=step2.json --input-annotation-list=annotation_list.txt\u201d.AnnotationsCell annotations, such as spatial domains and cell types, are required input for Giotto Viewer. In brief, Giotto Viewer supports both continuous- and discrete-value annotations. Annotations generated by Giotto Analyzer can be directly imported by using the exportGiottoFunction().Once panels, annotations, images are all prepared, then website files are created using: \u201csmfish_read_config -c step2.json -o test.js -p test.html -q test.css\u201d. A python webserver is next launched (python3 -m http.server) and the viewer can be viewed at http://localhost:8000/test.html.Implementation of interactive visualization of multi-layer spatial transcriptomic informationThe Giotto Viewer package is written in Javascript utilizing a number of state-of-the-art toolboxes including Leaflet.js (https://leafletjs.com/), Turf.js (https://turfjs.org/), Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/), and jQuery (https://jquery.com/). The Leaflet.js toolbox is used to efficiently visualize and explore multiple layers of information in the data, based on a Google Maps-like algorithm. Leaflet.js recognizes tiles prepared previously by the tileup package and implements caching of tiles and tile handling, allowing it to display large stitched images.As described above, Giotto Viewer contains 4 types of panels: PanelTsne, PanelPhysical, and PanelPhysicalSimple, PanelPhysical10X. The implementation of these 4 panels follows closely the paradigm of object-oriented design in Javascript, specified by the MDN Web Docs and ECMAScript. Briefly, the various panel types are motivated by the fact that depending on data availability, properties of cells change from dataset to dataset, so different ways of cell representation should be considered. In the presence of cell staining images, images should serve as background overlays to the data. If segmentation information is available, cells should be represented in their true cell shape. Yet when neither staining nor segmentation is available, Giotto Viewer represents cells as basic geometric shapes (circles) so that the viewer can still run in the absence of staining or segmentation data. We design the panel classes with these considerations in mind. Giotto Viewer makes it easy for users to specify the number of panels, the type of each panel, and the layout configuration. Users can specify such information in a JSON formatted configuration file. A script then automatically generates the HTML, CSS, and JS files of the comparative viewer that is ready for exploration in a standard web browser.To enable interactivity, panels are linked to each other. This is implemented by first defining mouseover and mouseout events for each cell object. The exact specification of events depends on the type of panel, the action chosen by the user, and the context in which the action is performed. Next, we maintain equivalent cell objects across panels by creating a master look-up table to link cell IDs in different panels. This is useful to facilitate interactive data exploration and comparison, synchronous updates of zoom and view positions during data exploration. Finally, the order and dependency with which interactions are executed are enforced by constantly polling element states and proceeding each step only when states are changed. In the API, the functions addInteractions(), addTooltips() enable the easy specification of cross-panel interactions. In the JSON configuration file, interactions between panels are simply defined by the user using the \u201cinteract_X: [panel ids]\u201d and \u201csync_X: [panel ids]\u201d lines.Giotto Viewer provides an intuitive utility to select a subset of cells of interest for visualization and further analysis. The toggle lasso utility allows a user to hand-draw an enclosed shape in any displayed panel to select cells directly. We implement this function by modifying the Leaflet-lasso.js toolbox to add support for the selection of the dynamic polygon-shaped markers. Giotto Viewer can also highlight Individual cells with summary information displayed. This is achieved by using built-in functions in the Turf.js toolbox.Visualizing subcellular transcript localizationTo visualize subcellular transcript localization information, an additional layer is created in Leaflet.js. To efficiently handle the large amount of data, we implemented new functions to cache only a small subset of transcripts that fall within the current viewing area, to be rendered by the Leaflet engine and thereby saving the system resources.Visualizing cell-type enrichment dataContinuous annotations providing cell type enrichment per spot are exported from Giotto Analyzer to Giotto Viewer via the exportGiotto() function. Then as with all other annotations, these are added to the setup JSON used to generate the website files. The cell type enrichments will appear under the \u201cAnnotations\u201d tab of the viewer panel.Selecting and exporting cellsTo encourage iterative analysis between the Giotto Viewer and Giotto Analyzer, users may select any cells of interest with the Lasso button. Then clicking \u201cSave\u201d will save the cell IDs that can be read in Giotto Analyzer within the R environment.\n\nAvailability of data and materials\nGeneral information, examples, and tutorials are available at http://www.spatialgiotto.com.

We developed an approach to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on global gene expression by integrating analysis of sequencing-based and imaging-based single-cell transcriptomic profiles, using cross-platform cell type mapping combined with a hidden Markov random field model. We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type- and spatial-domain-associated heterogeneity in the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated, cell-type-independent signatures in the glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments. Using these signatures to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified previously unknown spatially associated subpopulations, which were validated by comparison with anatomical structures and Allen Brain Atlas images.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainHuman and other multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that are characterized by distinct gene expression patterns. In each cell type, there is also considerable heterogeneity. The source of cellular heterogeneity remains poorly understood, but it is commonly thought to be modulated by the balance between intrinsic regulatory networks and extrinsic cellular microenvironment1,2,3,4,5. Recently, the rapid development of single-cell technologies has enabled accurate and simultaneous measurements of cell position and gene expression6,7,8,9, thereby providing an opportunity to systematically characterize cellular heterogeneity. However, the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in mediating cell-state variation remain poorly understood.Currently, there are two major, complementary approaches for single-cell transcriptomic profiling. The first is single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)6,8,10,11,12,13,14,15. By combining single-cell isolation, library amplification and massively parallel sequencing, scRNAseq provides the most comprehensive view of transcriptomes. The second approach is single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)7,16,17,18,19,20, which can be used to detect mRNA transcripts with high sensitivity while maintaining the spatial information. Each technology features a distinct set of advantages and limitations. The sequential smFISH technology has the advantage of measuring the transcriptome with high accuracy in its native spatial environment, but current implementations profile only a few hundred genes, whereas scRNAseq provides whole-transcriptome estimation, but requires cells to be removed from their spatial environment, resulting in a loss of spatial information19,21.To combine the benefits of both technologies, we developed a computational approach to integrate scRNAseq and sequential smFISH. First, we used the scRNAseq data as a guide to accurately determine the cell types corresponding to the cells profiled by sequential smFISH. Second, we systematically detected distinct spatial domain patterns from sequential smFISH data. These spatial patterns were then in turn used to dissect the environment-associated variation in a scRNAseq data set.This integrated approach allowed us to systematically dissect the respective contribution of spatially and cell-type-dependent factors in mediating cell-state variation (Fig. 1a), which has eluded previous studies. We analyzed the mouse visual cortex region and found that cell type differences represent only one component in cell-state variation, whereas the spatial environment had a substantial role in mediating gene activities, probably through cell-cell interactions (Fig. 1a) and signaling. Our integrated approach will be broadly applicable to the analysis of diverse tissues from various model systems.Figure 1: Overall goal of the project and cell type prediction in seqFISH data.(a) Cellular heterogeneity is driven by both cell type (indicated by shape) and environmental factors (indicated by colors). scRNAseq-based studies can only detect cell-type-related variation, as spatial information is lost. (b) Our goal was to decompose the contributions of each factor by developing methods to integrate scRNAseq and seqFISH data. (c) Prediction results evaluated by the comparison of cell type average expression profile across technologies for eight major cell types. Values represent expression z scores. SVM was tuned for the parameter C, which was set to 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 to optimize the cross-platform cell type to cell type correlations. The major cell types in the scRNAseq data set (Astro, n = 43 cells; Endo, n = 29; GABA-N, n = 761; Glut-N, n = 812; Micro, n = 22; OPC, n = 19; Oligo.1, n = 6; Oligo.2, n = 31) mapped to 97, 11, 556, 859, 22, 8, 21 and 23 cells in the seqFISH data set. (d) Pearson correlation between reference and predicted cell type averages ranged from 0.75 to 0.95. (e) Integration of seqFISH and scRNAseq data (illustrated in b) enabled cell type mapping with spatial information in the adult mouse visual cortex. Each cell type is labeled by a different color. Cell shape information was obtained from segmentation of cells from images (Online Methods). One mouse brain was assayed by seqFISH because of experimental cost.Full size imageResultsMapping scRNAseq cell types on seqFISH dataGiven that scRNAseq, as a whole transcriptomic approach, can provide signatures for a diverse set of cell types, we took advantage of the whole-transcriptomic information obtained from scRNAseq data and developed a supervised cell type mapping approach by integrating seqFISH and scRNAseq data (Fig. 1b). Our goal differed from that of previous studies22,23,24,25,26, where scRNAseq data were mapped onto conventional ISH images to predict cell locations. Traditional ISH images are not multiplexed or single-cell resolution. In a seqFISH experiment, transcripts from hundreds of genes are detected directly in individual cells in their native spatial environment at single-molecule resolution.Our strategy was to use scRNAseq data to capture the large cell type differences and then further investigate spatial patterning beyond cell type variations. We analyzed a published scRNAseq data set targeting the mouse visual cortex regions27. Eight major cell types, GABAergic, glutamatergic, astrocytes, three oligodendrocyte groups, microglia and endothelial cells, were identified from scRNAseq analysis27. To estimate the minimal number of genes that are required for accurate cell type mapping, we randomly selected a subset from the list of differentially expressed genes across these cell types and applied a multiclass support vector machine (SVM)28,29 model using only the expression levels of these genes. The performance was evaluated by cross-validation. By using only 40 genes, we were able to achieve an average level of 89% mapping accuracy. Increasing the number of genes led to better performance (92% for 60 genes and 96% for 80 genes). Thus, there is substantial redundancy in transcriptomic profiles, which can be compressed into fewer than 100 genes.We then investigated a seqFISH data set for the mouse visual cortex area19. We imaged a 1-mm \u00d7 1-mm contiguous area of the mouse visual cortex with four barcoded rounds of hybridization to decode 100 unique transcripts, followed by five rounds of non-combinatorial hybridization to quantify 25 highly expressed genes (Supplementary Table 1). These rounds of imaging were preceded by imaging of the DAPI stain in the region and followed by imaging of the Nissl stain to stain neurons in the region. The images were aligned and transcripts decoded as described previously19. Transcripts were assigned to cells that were segmented on the basis of Nissl and DAPI staining. We were able to quantify the expression levels of these 125 genes with high accuracy in a total of 1,597 cells.After identifying differentially expressed genes across the 8 major cell types in a previous study27, we selected the top 43 (P < 10\u221220) of these 125 genes for cell type classification. These genes contained both highly expressed (>50 copies per cell) and lowly expressed genes (<10 copies per cell). Cross-validation analysis revealed that, using these 43 genes as input, the SVM model accurately mapped 90.1% of the cells in the scRNAseq data to the correct cell type. Thus, we used these 43 genes (Supplementary Table 2) to map cell types in the seqFISH data.As a first step, we preprocessed the seqFISH data using a multi-image regression algorithm to reduce potential technical biases resulting from non-uniform imaging intensity variation (Online Methods). We further adopted a quantile normalization30 approach to calibrate the scaling and distribution differences between scRNAseq and seqFISH experiments. For most genes, the quantile-quantile (q-q) plot normalization curve was notably linear (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting a high degree of agreement between the two data sets despite technological differences. We then applied the SVM classification model to the bias-corrected, quantile-normalized seqFISH data to assign cell types. Of note, we found that better performance could be achieved by further calibrating model parameters to accommodate platform differences. The results of multiclass SVM were calibrated across models31 and converted to probabilities. We found that 5.5% cells were excluded, that is, they could not be confidently mapped to a single cell type (with 0.5 or less probability). Among the mapped cells, 54% were glutamatergic neurons, 37% were GABAergic neurons, 4.8% were astrocytes, and other glial cell types and endothelial cells comprised the remaining 4.2% of cells (Fig. 1c).To validate our predictions, we first checked the expression of known marker genes and compared the average gene expression profiles between scRNAseq and seqFISH data. Indeed, this comparison revealed a high degree of similarity (Fig. 1c). Notably, marker genes were, as expected, highly expressed in the matched cell types, such as Gja1 and Mfge8 in astrocytes, Laptm5 and Abca9 in microglia, Cldn5 in endothelial cells, Tbr1 and Gda in glutamatergic neurons, and Slc5a7 and Sox2 in GABAergic neurons. The majority of cell types had a high Pearson correlation (>0.8) between matched cell types' average expression profile; even for the rare cell type microglia, the correlation remained reasonably high (0.75) (Fig. 1d). We were also able to distinguish early maturing oligodendrocytes in the seqFISH data on the basis of Itpr2 expression (Fig. 1c), as previously reported15. Expression patterns of inhibitory GABAergic neurons and excitatory glutamatergic neurons exhibited strong anti-correlation (Fig. 1d).As an additional validation, we compared the neurons that were stained with Nissl and DAPI with astrocytes that were only stained with DAPI. Our cell type mapping results agree with these patterns. Over 89% of predicted astrocytes exhibited strong DAPI staining, but weak or no Nissl staining, across cortex columns (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 3). Taken together, these analyses indicate that the majority of cells were mapped to the correct cell types.By combining cell type predictions from scRNAseq and positional information from seqFISH, we were able to construct a single-cell resolution landscape of cell type spatial distribution (Fig. 1e). As expected, this landscape is very complex, with different cell types intermixed with each other (Fig. 1e). On the other hand, it is clear that there remains substantial heterogeneity in each cell type.A systematic approach to identify multicellular nicheMicroenvironment in tissues can contribute to heterogeneity in addition to cell-type-specific expression patterns. To systematically dissect the contributions of microenvironments on gene expression variation, we developed a hidden-Markov random field (HMRF) approach32 to unbiasedly inform the organizational structure of the visual cortex (Fig. 2a). The basic assumption is that the visual cortex can be divided into domains with coherent gene expression patterns. A domain may be formed by a cluster of cells from the same cell type, but it may also consist of multiple cell types. In the latter scenario, the expression patterns of cell-type-specific genes may not be spatially coherent, but environment-associated genes would be expressed in spatial domains. A HMRF enables the detection of spatial domains by systematically comparing the gene signature of each cell with its surroundings to search for coherent patterns. Briefly, we computationally constructed an undirected graph to represent the spatial relationship among the cells, connecting any pair of cells that were immediate neighbors (Fig. 2a,b). Each cell was represented as a node in this graph. The domain state of each cell was influenced by two sources (Fig. 2b): its gene expression pattern and the domain states of neighboring cells. The total contribution of neighboring cells can be mathematically represented as a continuous energy field, and the optimal solution is identified by searching for the equilibrium of the field (Online Methods and Supplementary Note 1).Figure 2: Spatial domain dissection in seqFISH data using HMRF.(a) A schematic overview of the HMRF model. A neighborhood graph represents the spatial relationship between imaged cells (indicated by the circles) in the seqFISH data. The edges connect neighboring cells. seqFISH-detected multigene expression profiles are used together with the graph topology to identify spatial domains. In contrast, k-means and other clustering methods do not utilize spatial information and the results are therefore expected to be less coherent (illustrated in the dashed box). (b) An intuitive illustration of the basic principles in a HMRF model. For a hypothetical cell (indicated by the question mark), its spatial domain assignment is inferred from combining information from gene expression (xi) and neighborhood configuration (cNi). The color of each node represents the cell's expression and the number inside each node is the domain number. In this hypothetical example, combining such information results in the cell being assigned to domain 1, instead of domain 3 (Online Methods). (c) HMRF identified spatial domain configuration in the mouse visual cortex region. Distinct domains revealed a resemblance to layer organization of cortex. Naming of domains: I1a, I1b, I2 and I3 are inner domains distributed in the inner layers. O1\u2013O4 are outer domains. IS represents the inner scattered state. These domains are associated with cell morphological features, such as distinct cell shape differences in outer layer domains. Cell shape information was obtained from the segmentation of cells from images (Online Methods). For HMRF, 1,000 initial centroids were used and the best configuration was selected to initialize HMRF. The procedure was repeated two more times with similar results. (d) General domain signatures are shared between cells within domains. P values signify two-sided Welch's t tests with P values adjusted for multiple comparisons. Genes with significant P values are shown. All domains are compared: O2 (n = 109 cells), I1a (n = 389), O4 (n = 120), I1b (n = 79), O1 (n = 135), I2 (n = 117), I3 (n = 205), O3 (n = 270) and IS (n = 173).Full size imageNext, we applied our HMRF model to analyze the 1,597-cell mouse visual cortex seqFISH data set. The expression of the 125 genes ranged from being highly scattered to spatially organized. To enhance spatial domain detection, we defined a spatial coherence score and selected the top 80 genes for HMRF analysis (Online Methods). As an additional filter, we further removed 11 genes that were highly specific to a single cell type, resulting in 69 genes (Supplementary Table 4) for spatial domain identification. We found that this additional filtering step improved the resolution while preserving the overall spatial pattern (Supplementary Fig. 2).HMRF modeling of the visual cortex region revealed nine spatial domains (Fig. 2c). These domains had distinct spatial patterns; some displayed a layered organization that resembled the anatomical structure33. For example, four of the domains were located on the outer layers of the cortex, and we labeled them as O1, O2, O3 and O4 (Fig. 2c). The locations of these layers roughly corresponded to the well-characterized L1, L6 and external capsule (EC) layers, respectively. Four domains were located on the inside of the cortex therefore labeled as I1a, I1b, I2, and I3, respectively (Fig. 2c). These domains roughly corresponded to the L2\u20135 layers. These inner domains were less pronounced than the outer domains, which is consistent with previous anatomical analysis. Finally, one domain was sporadically distributed across in the inner layers of the cortex, and we labeled it as IS (Fig. 2c). Of note, such domain-like patterns were not visible in the cell type localization pattern (Fig. 1e). Consistent with these results, a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot using these 69 genes identified clustering patterns that were similar to the domain annotations but differed greatly from the cell type annotations (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results strongly suggest that HMRF provides complementary information to cell type annotations.By overlaying cell type annotations, we found that each domain generally consisted of a mixture of GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes interacting in each environment (Supplementary Fig. 4). The decomposition of mouse visual cortex into spatial domains suggests that a spatial gene expression program is shared across cells in proximity. Differential gene expression analysis identified distinct signatures, which we labeled as the general domain signatures, associated with each spatial domain (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 5\u20137). For example, the genes Calb1, Cpne5 and Nov were preferentially expressed in inner domains (I1a, I1b), whereas Serpinb11 and Capn13 were highly enriched in outer domains (O1, O2). Different outer domains could be further distinguished by additional markers, such as Mmgt1 (O3), Aldh3b2 (O1) and Fam69c (O2). Notably, these spatial gene signatures transcended multiple cell types and were therefore distinct from cell-type-specific signatures (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). The spatial marker genes, including Calb1, Cpne5 and Nov, were highly consistent with their spatial expression in Allen Brain Atlas33 ISH images (Supplementary Fig. 8). Other markers, such as Nell1, Aldh3b2 and Gdf5, had layer-specific expressions that were consistent with previous results15 (Supplementary Fig. 8). We summarized the gene signature of each domain as a metagene, defined as the average expression of the subset of genes that were specifically associated with the domain. This provides an 'analog' representation of the spatial domain information as an additional diagnostic (Supplementary Fig. 9). Taken together, these analyses strongly suggest that our model for analyzing seqFISH data is able to detect functionally and transcriptionally distinct spatial environments.Interactions between cell type and spatial environmentGlutamatergic neurons mediate the neuronal circuit in the visual cortex via a primarily excitatory function. It is also well-known that the behavior of different glutamatergic neurons can be very different27,34. Using a combination of cell type mapping and spatial domain identification, we set out to dissect the source of heterogeneity in glutamatergic cells. First, nearly all glutamatergic cells expressed cell-type-specific markers, such as Gda and Tbr1 (Fig. 3a). In addition to cell type identity, there exists substantial spatially dependent heterogeneity in glutamatergic cells. Given that glutamatergic cells are spread across all nine domains, each subset expressed a different gene signature in accordance with domain annotation (Fig. 3a). First, the general domain signatures (Fig. 2d), aggregated as metagenes, could be used to separate glutamatergic cells into domains (Fig. 3a). Second, beyond the general signature, an additional set of gene signatures were differentially expressed between glutamatergic cells in different domains (Fig. 3a). To distinguish these genes from the general domain signatures, which transcend cell types, we referred to these genes as the glutamatergic-restricted signatures. For example, Mmp8 expression was restricted to domain O2 (Fig. 3a), whereas Hoxb8 expression was specific to O3 and Nfkb2 to IS (Fig. 3a). Collectively, the domain-specific signatures mapped out the spatial patterns of expression in glutamatergic cells, demonstrating their power to differentiate subgroups of this cell type (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201311).Figure 3: HMRF analysis identified domain-associated heterogeneity in glutamatergic cells.(a) Three major sources of variations in glutamatergic neurons (n = 859). Glutamatergic neurons were distributed across nine domains with 79, 187, 88, 58, 93, 60, 73, 129 and 92 cells in O2, I1a, O4, I1b, O1, I2, I3, O3 and IS domains, respectively. Top, cell-type-specific signals: Gda and Tbr1. Middle, general domain signatures, as shown in Figure 2d, were summarized as metagene expression. Bottom, glutamatergic-restricted domain signatures, as identified by comparing glutamatergic cells across domains and removing signatures that were general domain signatures. Signature genes were obtained by two-sided Welch's t tests with P values adjusted for multiple comparisons. (b) Snapshots of single cells. Each row shows a snapshot of cells at the boundary of two layers. Each of two columns is a type of annotation. Left, cell type; right, HMRF domains. Cell type annotation was incapable of explaining layer-to-layer morphological variations; for example, glutamatergic cells (orange) were present in all layers, yet morphological differences existed in glutamatergic cells. HMRF domains better captured the boundary of two layers in each case, in that the domains could separate distinct morphologies. A systematic comparison is shown in Supplementary Figure 12 (see also Supplementary Fig. 11).Full size imageBy visual inspection, we observed notable morphological variations near the boundary between different domains at multiple regions (Fig. 3b), including change of circularity and cell orientations, and these were accompanied by metagene expression switches (Supplementary Fig. 11). To systematically compare the morphological differences between different domains, we extracted quantitative information of 15 different morphological features per cell based on the Nissl staining images and compared the statistical distributions across different domains. Indeed, we found that a number of features displayed strong domain associations, including circularity in O4 (P < 6.1 \u00d7 10\u221212), width in I1b (P < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221214), angle in O3 (P < 6.7 \u00d7 10\u221218) and minimum feret diameter in I1a (P < 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221211) (Supplementary Fig. 12). Of note, these differences could not be identified by cell type mapping alone (Fig. 3b). Thus, in neuronal cell types, such as glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons, substantial morphological differences remain across domains, suggesting that spatial positions account for a large part of the morphologies of these cells, consistent with known morphological diversity in the cortex. Overall, these analyses strongly suggest that spatial domain variation is important for mediating cellular heterogeneity.Using HMRF domain information to reanalyze scRNAseq dataScRNAseq data does not contain spatial information. However, using domain signatures derived from seqFISH as a guide, we were able to infer spatial locations from scRNAseq data. To dissect the contribution of environmental factors to transcriptomic heterogeneity, we focused on glutamatergic cells and combined the general domain signatures with the additional set of markers that are glutamatergic restrictive. Using these expanded domain signatures (Supplementary Table 5) summarized as metagenes, we were able to uncover a hidden structure in the glutamatergic cells (Fig. 4a,b). Notably, the glutamatergic cells could be partitioned into nine different clusters on the basis of the expanded domain signatures, which were highly consistent with seqFISH data analysis (Fig. 4a,b). As such, these clusters were labeled according to their enriched metagene signatures (Fig. 4a).Figure 4: Reanalysis of single-cell RNAseq data (from ref. 27) with domain signatures summarized into metagenes.(a) t-SNE plot shows how the 812 glutamatergic cells from ref. 27 cluster according to expanded domain signatures aggregated as metagenes (shown in b). Colors indicate k-means clusters (k = 9). Each cluster is annotated by its enriched metagene expression. Nine annotated glutamatergic metagene clusters were identified: O2 (n = 132 cells), I1a (n = 98), O4 (n = 92), I1b (n = 131), O1 (n = 84), I2 (n = 22), I3 (n = 97), O3 (n = 100) and IS (n = 56).

Column, layer annotation information obtained from microdissection27, with L1\u2013L2/3 (n = 48 cells), L4 (n = 202), L5 (n = 116), L6 (n = 12), L6a (n = 87) and L6b (n = 33). Row, metagene-based cell clusters. Shown are hypergeometric P values of cell overlaps. (d) Inferred spatial clusters of glutamatergic neurons were enriched in distinct GO biological processes. Shown are hypergeometric P values of gene overlaps between differentially expressed genes (n = 500) of each metagene cluster and Gene Ontology gene sets (variable sizes). P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons.Full size imageWe compared the inferred domain annotations with the original sites of dissection in a previous study27. Several domains matched the corresponding layer structure very well (Fig. 4c). For example, cluster 1 (annotated as domain I1a based on metagene analysis) significantly overlapped with L1\u2013L2/3 (P < 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126). Cluster 2 (annotated as domain O2) overlapped with L6b (P < 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22129), and cluster 9 (annotated as domain I3) significantly overlapped with L6a (P < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22128). On the other hand, clusters 3\u20135 (annotated as domains O4, I2 and IS) did not correspond to specific layers.Using the whole transcriptomes from scRNAseq, we searched for additional domain-specific gene signatures based on coexpression analysis. Our analysis identified a number of genes that were not assayed by seqFISH, including Tubb2a (I1a) and Ndrg3 (O4). We examined the corresponding ISH images in the Allen Brain Atlas and found that the inferred spatial patterns agreed well with the imaging data (Supplementary Fig. 13). We further conducted gene set enrichment analysis based on the inferred domain-specific markers and identified a number of functional biological processes that were enriched in specific domains (Fig. 4d).An important question is whether the distinction between the subpopulations identified through our integrative analysis simply reflect cell subtype differences that can be identified through scRNAseq analysis alone. To address this question, we systematically compared the domain and cell subtype annotations using a number of approaches, including the underlying gene signatures, the grouping of cells based on domain or cell subtype annotations, and tSNE-based visualizations (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). Based on these comparisons, we came to two conclusions. On one hand, we observed a non-negligible association between the two sets of annotations, such as at L6b_Serpinb11, L2/3_Ptgs2 and L6a_Sla (Supplementary Fig. 14). For example, several domain-specific markers were also markers of specific cell subtypes, such as Serpinb11, Cpne5 and Sema3e (Supplementary Fig. 16a). On the other hand, it was also clear that the overall structure of domain and subtype annotations were very different. For example, cells whose locations we inferred to be in domains O1, IS and O4 spread across multiple subtypes (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 16b). Conversely, neither the L5a_Batf3 nor L5a_Hsd11b1 subtype was associated with any specific domain (Supplementary Fig. 14). Taken together, these analyses strongly indicate that the domain patterns are distinct from, and therefore complementary to, cell subtype annotations. Thus, integrating seqFISH data analysis provides new insights into scRNAseq data.Region-specific variation among astrocytesNext, we investigated the environment effect on astrocytes, which are also known to have substantial heterogeneity20,35. Our cell type mapping identified 48 astrocytes in the seqFISH data. These cells all expressed key astrocyte markers but were spread across five different spatial domains (O1, O2, O3, I1a and I3; Fig. 5a). Of note, a number of astrocyte markers20 were only expressed in specific domains (Supplementary Fig. 17). As an example, Acta2, Col5a1 and Sox2 were strongly associated with domain I1a, whereas their expression levels were greatly reduced in domains O1 and O2. On the other hand, the expression levels of Clec5a and Ankle1 were high in domains O2 and O1 but were much lower in other domains. The spatially dependent variations might underline important functional differences.Figure 5: Spatially dependent astrocyte variation revealed by HMRF.Neighborhood cell type composition for the 48 astrocyte cells (columns). Cells are ordered by HMRF domain annotations. The heat map shows single-cell expression of astrocytes clustered by domain-specific genes. Blue-box highlights the common signatures expressed in each domain's astrocyte population. Identified astrocyte subpopulations are O2 (n = 5), I1a (n = 9), O1 (n = 5), I3 (n = 16) and O3 (n = 13).Full size imageDiscussionA major goal in single-cell analysis is to systematically dissect the contributions of cell types and environment to cell-state variability. We developed an HMRF-based computational approach to combine the strengths of sequencing and imaging-based single-cell transcriptomic profiling strategies. We used our method to detect spatial domains in the mouse visual cortex region. In doing so, we were able to identify environment-associated variations. Our analysis also demonstrated that further insights can be gleaned from single-cell data by integrating information from complementary technologies. In particular, integrating scRNAseq data allowed us to map cell types more accurately than using seqFISH data analysis alone, whereas integrating seqFISH data allowed us to extract spatial structure in scRNAseq data analysis. Although the classification of a small number of isolated cells as domains may be questionable, such events were rare and did not affect the overall spatial domain patterns.To test the generalizability of our method, we used it to analyze a published spatial transcriptomic data set obtained from a very different technology at olfactory bulbs36. Here, spatial information was identified by hybridizing mRNA to a specially designed tissue microarray containing spatial barcoding oligo-probes. Despite the substantial platform differences, our HMRF model was able to recapitulate the spatial domains that are consistent with the underlying anatomical structures (Supplementary Fig. 18). In another example, we analyzed seqFISH data19 obtained from a different region of the mouse brain (dentate gyrus) using different probes. Again, the results were consistent with the anatomical structure (Supplementary Fig. 19). These analyses strongly indicate that our method is generally applicable. Of note, our HMRF model is agnostic about the cell type composition and associated gene signatures. Moreover, its application does not require single-cell resolution data, as it can also detect spatial patterns on larger scales.Two recent studies have also investigated spatially variable genes. Specifically, SpatialDE37 is designed to identify individual genes whose expression levels at neighboring sites are correlated. Of note, SpatialDE does not identify spatial regions with distinct expression patterns. Similarly, trendsceek38 is also designed to detect spatial dependency. However, its application is limited to a single gene at a time. In contrast, our HMRF method can simultaneously detect the combinatorial pattern of all profiled genes. A unique aspect of our study was the integration of cell type and spatial domain annotations. This is important for systematically dissecting the roles of intrinsic regulatory networks and spatial environment in the maintenance of cellular states. Future work will be needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the interactions between cell type and microenvironment.MethodsSeqFISH data generation.SeqFISH data in the mouse visual cortex region was generated as described previously19. Briefly, 100 genes were encoded using a temporal barcoding method and 25 genes were quantified individually. To encode 100 genes, four rounds of hybridization were performed using five distinct fluorescence channels. Out of a total possible 625 barcodes, 100 were chosen such that loss of signal in any given hybridization still allows accurate decoding of the spot. Every transcript was hybridized in every round using a given probe set. After hybridization, the signal was amplified using smHCR and images were taken at predefined locations in the mouse visual cortex. The DNA probes along with the amplification polymers were digested using DNase I leaving behind a naked RNA for re-hybridization with the next probe set. A round of imaging with DAPI staining (which labels the DNA) was done before any RNA hybridization to image all nuclei in the fields and a final round of Nissl staining (which labels the cell body in neuronal cells) was imaged to identify cell boundaries. Cells were segmented based on DAPI staining, Nissl staining, and RNA point density. Once all imaging rounds were completed, these images were aligned using a two-dimensional (2D) normalized cross correlation and each spot was decoded based on the unique color switching pattern. For the 25 genes that were labeled without any barcoding, simple spot counting was done to identify the number of transcripts. These transcripts were then assigned to cells based on the location of the transcript and the segmentation masks. For more details regarding the seqFISH method, please refer to ref. 19. The spatial coordinates of the cells are provided on our website (see data availability).SeqFISH data normalization and bias correction.The seqFISH gene expression matrix, represented by log(count + 1), was normalized by row and column z-scoring to remove cell-specific and gene-specific biases. Potential field imaging biases were estimated and removed by using a multi-image regression algorithm similar as previously done39. Briefly, for each gene, the imaging bias at each binned location was estimated by averaging the normalized gene expression levels over eight neighboring bins in each field followed by averaging across all fields. The estimated bias was then modeled by principal component analysis. The contributions of the four most significant principal components were estimated by linear regression and removed from the normalized gene expression matrix (Supplementary Fig. 20).Cell type mapping.Single-cell RNAseq data for the mouse visual cortex were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus40 (GSE71585). Cell type information corresponding to 1,723 cells was obtained from the original paper27. In this analysis, we considered the eight major cell types: GABAergic, glutamatergic, astrocytes, three oligodendrocyte groups, microglia, and endothelial cells. Differentially expressed genes among different cell types were identified by MAST41.We trained classifiers of cell types from single-cell RNAseq data set by using the multiclass SVM formulation. For each cell type, we built a classifier as follows. Let xi, i = 1,..., n, be the gene expression pattern for the i-th cell, and yi code for cell type identity: yi = 1 if cell i belongs to the specified cell type and -1 otherwise. We selected the linear kernel that produces two hyperplanes that best separates the two classes. The objective function is defined as followsHere w is the normal vector to the hyperplane used to represent margin. The squared hinge loss function  is used here to quantify the margin of misclassification error. C is a regularization parameter that trades off misclassification due to overfitting against simplicity of the decision function. A lower C increases the ability of the model to generalize to unseen data at a cost of larger fitting error. For testing data, the sign of w\u00b7xi \u2212 b is used to predict cell type identity. We used the Python LinearSVC implementation, which is part of the scikit-learn 0.19 library42, with the following parameter setting: class_weights = balanced, dual = False, max_iter = 10,000, and tol = 1 \u00d7 10\u22124.Using the SVM model formulated as above, we first tested how many genes are needed for accurate cell-type mapping. To this end, we randomly subset 20, 40, 60 and 80 genes from the list of differentially expressed genes and, for each gene set, built a vanilla SVM classification model to map each cell in the single-cell RNAseq data set to its corresponding cell type. The accuracy was evaluated by using fourfold cross-validation. Our results indicated that a high accuracy (>90%) can be obtained with 40 or more genes.In addition to the major cell types mentioned above, a previous study27 also identified 22 fine cell classes, and 49 minor cell classes. Using the same approach, we also evaluated the accuracy of refined cell type mapping (Supplementary Fig. 21). We found that approximately 200 genes were required to achieve 85% accuracy in predicting 22 finer classes, and over 800 genes were needed to predict the 49 minor cell types with 75% accuracy. Therefore, we focused on the mapping of eight major cell types on seqFISH given that they can be predicted accurately with fewer than 100 genes (ROC curves in Supplementary Fig. 22).To map cell types in the seqFISH data, we made a few modifications to incorporate the platform differences. First, since 125 genes were profiled by seqFISH, we used the intersection with the top differentially expressed genes (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u221220) in the scRNAseq data set for cell type mapping, thereby selecting 43 genes in total. Based on the subsampling analysis described above, these 43 genes were sufficient for accurate cell type mapping. Second, the scRNAseq data were z-score transformed so that the dynamic range was comparable with seqFISH data. Third, we used quantile normalization30 to convert seqFISH data so that the statistical distribution was almost identical to single-cell RNAseq data. Fourth, we chose the regularization parameter C to maximize the cross-platform correlation between the cell-type specific gene expression profiles, resulting an estimate of C = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126. Finally, to account for the possibility that certain cells cannot be unequivocally assigned to a single cell type, we used Platt scaling31 to convert SVM output to a probability measure and then selected a cutoff value of 0.5 probability to filter cells that can be confidently mapped to a single cell type. 97 (5%) cells did not pass this filter.HMRF.HMRF is a graph-based model commonly used for pattern recognition in image data analyses32,43. In a common setting, HMRF is used to model the spatial distribution of a signal, such as the pixel intensities over a 2D image. The spatial structure is represented as a set of nodes on a regular grid, where neighboring nodes are connected to each other. The spatial pattern is 'hidden' in the sense that it must be indirectly estimated from other variables that can be directly measured. The most important assumption in HMRF is the Markov property, which states that the spatial constraints can be reduced to considering only correlation between immediate neighboring nodes. This simplifying assumption implies that the joint distribution can be decomposed as products of much smaller components each defined on a fully connected subgraph (termed cliques). As has been done previously, we decomposed the graph into size-2 components (or edges in the graph) that provides a convenient means to estimating the MRF by using pairwise energies.Specifically, let S = {Si} be the nodes in the graph. The set of nodes and the adjacency relation as defined by the local neighborhood graph forms the neighborhood system (S, {Ni}). Every node is associated with observed signal values xi. Let C = {ci = 1,...,K} represent the set of possible classes of patterns. The joint probability that a node Si is associated with class ci is specified by the following equation:In the right hand side, the term P(xi|ci,si) models the effect of the node Si's own gene expression, whereas  models the effect of the neighboring cells configuration . The combined effect of these two terms is schematically shown in Figure 2. The latter term is further determined by the Gibbs distribution:where U(cj, ci) is referred to as the energy function. The exact formulation of U(cj, ci) is dependent on the specific application, and it imposes the assumption of how neighboring nodes interact with each other. Here we use the special case Pott's model.which means that the effects of neighboring cells are additive. Essentially,  expresses the total energies as a summation of pairwise interaction energies with neighbors. The parameter beta reflects the strength of interactions.Application to seqFISH data.The HMRF model described above is naturally applicable to analyze seqFISH data. Here each class of patterns corresponds to a spatial domain. The observed signals are gene expression levels measured by seqFISH data, whose distribution is modeled as a multivariate Gaussian random variable. The application of HMRF to seqFISH data analysis involves the following four components: neighboring graph representation, gene selection, domain number selection, and model inference. The details of each component are described below.1. Neighborhood graph representation. An undirected graph was constructed to represent the spatial relationship between the cells. Each node represents a cell, and each edge connects a pair of neighboring cells. The neighborhood size was chosen such that on average each cell has five neighboring cells.2. Gene selection. We selected a subset of genes whose expression patterns tend to be spatially coherent based on the following analysis. For each gene g, cells were divided into two mutually exclusive sets: the first set, denoted by L1, contains cells with high expression at the 90th percentile expression level cutoff, and the rest of the cells were denoted by L0. The spatial coherence of gene expression was quantified as the Silhouette coefficient44 of the spatial distance associated with these two cell sets. Specifically, the Silhouette coefficient is calculated as:where for a given cell si in set L1, mi is defined as the average distance between si and any cell in L0, and ni is defined as the average distance between si and any other cell in L1. Here, we used the rank-normalized, exponentially transformed distance to quantify the local physical distance between two cells. For a pair of cells si and sj, this distance is defined as  where rankd(si, sj) is the mutual rank45 of si and sj in the vectors of euclidean distances {Euc(si, *)} and {Euc(sj, *)}. Hence, this exponentially weighted function46 is designed to place more emphasis on closely located cells and penalize far-away cells' distance. q is a rank-weighting constant (0 < q < 1.0) set at 0.95. The statistical significance of \u03b4g was evaluated by random permutation, and the genes associated with significant values of \u03b4g (P < 0.05) were selected as spatially coherent.Using the above criteria, we found 80 spatially coherent genes. We further removed 11 cell type specific genes (MAST P < 1 \u00d7 10\u221220) which have average expression z-score > 2. We found this additional filtering step is useful for improving the resolution while preserving the overall spatial pattern (Supplementary Fig. 2). We repeated the analysis using varying degree of stringency for selecting spatially coherent genes (Supplementary Fig. 23), varying the degree of excluding cell-type-specific genes (Supplementary Fig. 2), and varying beta (Supplementary Fig. 24), and found that the overall patterns identified by the HMRF model is robust against these variations.3. Domain number selection. We used k-means clustering results as initialization for the HMRF domains. The value of k was selected based on the gap-statistics47.4. Implementation and model inference. The model parameters were inferred by using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm48. We developed a new implementation based on the MRITC R package49 and GraphColoring Java package50. The implementation contains modifications to accommodate arbitrary neighborhood graph topology. The domain assignment for each cell was determined by using maximum a posteriori estimation, which can be viewed as the equilibrium state of the energy function. See Supplementary Note 1 for implementation details.Robustness analysis of the HMRF model.We also tested the robustness of our HMRF model against spatial perturbation. This was achieved by randomly exchanging the spatial locations of a subset of cells (10, 20, 40 and 100%). At 100% exchanging rate, the spatial coherence is completely disrupted. Log-likelihood of the HMRF model was recorded and compared across scenarios. As expected, the log-likelihood achieves maximum at a low perturbation rate and gradually decreases as the exchange rate increases. The difference between the perturbed and unperturbed data is highly statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. 25).Domain-specific gene signatures.For each spatial domain, we identified a subset of genes that were significantly upregulated in the domain compared to cells in other regions. Specifically, we require that the selected gene be both significant in one-versus-one tests (comparing it to one domain at a time, and pass significance threshold P < 0.05 in at least seven of eight such tests, Welch's t test) and significant in one-versus-rest test (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22126, Welch's t test). The use of t test is justified as the expression z-scores are approximately normally distributed (Supplementary Fig. 26). Non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U tests yield similar signatures (Supplementary Fig. 27). Accordingly, we defined a metagene signature as the average expression level for this subset of upregulated genes. These domain-associated metagene signatures (Fig. 2d) transcend cell types (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Furthermore, we restricted this comparison to each specific cell type, and obtained an additional list of genes that are differentially expressed between domains. An expanded domain-metagene signatures was then defined based on the merged gene subsets. For glutamatergic cells, the expanded metagene signatures are summarized in Supplementary Table 5.Analysis of spatial structure in the single-cell RNAseq data.To systematically characterize the spatial structure in a scRNAseq data, we summarized the gene signature associated with each spatial domain as a metagene (as described in the previous section). For simplicity, the overall expression of an expanded domain-specific metagene signature in each cell was quantified as the mean z-scored expression of all constituent genes in the signature. A t-SNE analysis was performed on this matrix using the Rtsne package with parameters pca_scale = T, perplexity = 35. Cell subpopulations with similar metagene expression patterns were identified by K-means clustering analysis (K = 9). We next annotated each cluster as belonging to the expression of one metagene. By comparing the binarized metagene expression population (Fig. 4b) and the K-means cluster annotations (Fig. 4a), all of the K-means clusters were assigned as uniquely associated with a single metagene.For each subpopulation discovered from metagene clustering above, we found differentially expressed (DE) genes for the population (two-sample t test, unequal variance, P < 0.05). With the DE genes, we carried out Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (using hypergeometric test) for each of the nine subpopulations to construct a functional enrichment profile (hypergeometric test, top 500 DE genes analyzed per group, multiple hypothesis51 corrected P < 0.05; Fig. 4). Here we used genes expressed in glutamatergic cells as the background gene-set when doing enrichment analysis.Ref. 27 also provides layer information for a glutamatergic cell subset based on the layer from which the cells were manually dissected using different Cre-lines. To test whether the extracted subpopulation based on metagenes is enriched for a certain manually dissected layer of cells, we also performed hypergeometric test corrected for multiple hypothesis comparing manual annotations of cells to our HMRF-domain-based annotations.Visualization of spatial domain and cell-type-specific variations.We created box plots to visualize the range of expression values for cells in different domains and for different cell types. In addition, to evaluate cell type transcending effect of domain signature genes, for each gene, we grouped cells by (cell type, spatial domain) pair, and plotted the expression distribution across groups ordered by spatial domains. Groups with less than four cells were removed, as these skewed the comparison.Morphological analysis.We loaded the cell segmentations as regions of interest files (ROI) in ImageJ52, then used the Measure tool available in ImageJ to quantitatively measure over 15 morphological features for individual cells. We compared the distributions across different cell types by using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Statistical significance is judged by both 1) significance in at least seven of eight one-versus-one tests (P < 0.05 per test), and 2) significance in one-versus-rest test (P < 0.0001).Code availability.Code has been deposited at https://bitbucket.org/qzhudfci/smfishhmrf-py.Reporting Summary.Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data availability.Expression data, spatial coordinates, SVM predictions, HMRF domains, expression box plots categorized by domains and cell types, and interactive visualizations are available at http://spatial.rc.fas.harvard.edu.

However, the number of cell types in VMHvl and their relationship to connectivity and behavioral function are unknown. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing using two independent platforms\u2014SMART-seq (\u223c4,500 neurons) and 10x (\u223c78,000 neurons)\u2014and investigated correspondence between transcriptomic identity and axonal projections or behavioral activation, respectively. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) identified 17 transcriptomic types (T-types), including several sexually dimorphic clusters, the majority of which were validated by seqFISH. Immediate early gene analysis identified T-types exhibiting preferential responses to intruder males versus females but only rare examples of behavior-specific activation. Unexpectedly, many VMHvl T-types comprise a mixed population of neurons with different projection target preferences. Overall our analysis revealed that, surprisingly, few VMHvl T-types exhibit a clear correspondence with behavior-specific activation and connectivity.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (168KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordshypothalamuscell typesVMHestrogen receptorsocial behaviorsingle-cell RNA sequencingaggressionmatingsexual dimorphismmetabolismRecommended articlesCited by (0)6Lead contact\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainIn order to respond to environmental conditions, cells make extensive use of combinatorial gene regulation, in which two or more transcription factors co-regulate common target genes. Most analysis of combinatorial regulation presumes that the concentrations of transcription factors in the nucleus are regulated in a continuous (non-pulsatile) manner1,2. However, recent work has identified a large and growing list of transcription factors that activate in pulses3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. In such systems, a single pulse begins when many molecules of a given transcription factor are activated simultaneously, and ends when they are deactivated. Such pulses can occur repetitively, even under constant conditions. Pulsatile regulation has been observed in bacteria9,12,13, yeast8,10,14,15,16,17, and mammalian stress response and signalling pathways6,7,11,18,19,20,21,22,23. In these systems, inputs typically modulate the pulse frequency, amplitude, and/or duration of individual transcription factors to regulate genes. However, despite analysis of many individual pulsatile transcription factors, the interactions between multiple pulsatile systems in the same cell have not yet been explored and analysed.Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides an ideal model system to analyse such dynamic transcription factor interactions. It contains several well-characterized pulsatile systems that control core cellular functions. In particular, the general stress response transcription factor Msn2, and its paralogue, Msn4, activate hundreds of target genes in response to diverse stresses including ethanol, heat, oxidative stress, salt, and glucose starvation24,25,26,27,28,29,30. Similarly, the repressor Mig1, along with its paralogue, Mig2, control many target genes, especially those involved in metabolism, in response to changes in glucose concentration31,32,33. Together, Msn2 and Mig1 co-regulate over 300 target genes (according to Yeastract34). Both Msn2 and Mig1 are activated by dephosphorylation, which leads to nuclear localization35,36,37. Previous work has shown that Msn2 nuclear localization can occur in a pulsatile fashion in response to various inputs8,10,14,17,38. Mig1 is known to quickly localize to the nucleus in response to an increase in glucose levels36, and can also exhibit pulsatile activation38.Two stages of dynamic pulsingTo analyse Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics in the same cell, we constructed strains expressing fusions of Msn2 and Mig1 proteins to the distinguishable fluorescent proteins39 mKO2 and mCherry, respectively (Fig. 1a). To simplify the analysis, we knocked out their paralogues Msn4 and Mig2 (Methods). We attached single cells to the glass surface of a microfluidic channel, maintaining a constant flow of media, while acquiring time-lapse movies. By analysing individual cells in these movies, we could track the nuclear localization dynamics of both proteins over time (Methods).Figure 1: Temporally structured pulsing of transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 in response to glucose reduction.a, Inputs such as glucose regulate the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Msn2 and Mig1, which co-regulate some common target genes. Three-colour strains allow simultaneous analysis of Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization dynamics and target gene expression. Yeast strains contained Msn2 (green) and Mig1 (red) fluorescent protein fusions, along with a target promoter with (shown) or without (not shown) binding sites for Msn2 and Mig1, driving expression of a transcript containing 24 stem-loops that are specifically bound by the PP7 RNA binding protein fused to 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009GFP (blue circles). b, An example single-cell trace showing nuclear localization dynamics of Msn2 and Mig1. The cell exhibits an immediate temporally structured response to the step in glucose (arrowhead and dashed line), as well as sporadic pulsing throughout the movie. Filmstrips show examples of non-overlapping and overlapping events. White dashed circles indicate cell boundaries and numbers indicate time points. Scale bar is 2\u2009\u03bcm. Lower plot shows average trace, revealing the synchronized transient non-overlapping response followed by a constant average response due to unsynchronized pulsing. Shading indicates 95% confidence intervals of the mean (Methods). c, These dynamics provoke the questions of how inputs modulate relative timing of Msn2 and Mig1 pulses, and how that timing affects gene regulation.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageWe first analysed the effects of glucose reduction, which is known to induce changes in nuclear localization for both transcription factors35,36. In response to a sudden step from 0.2% to 0.1% glucose, both proteins exhibited pulses of nuclear localization, but did so with different timing (Fig. 1b). Msn2 localized to the nucleus immediately, while Mig1 exited the nucleus. Subsequently, in many cells (75%), Msn2 exited the nucleus followed by the re-entry of Mig1 (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Video 1). This transient response terminated within \u223c30 min (Fig. 1b, bottom). We describe events like this, in which Msn2 and Mig1 pulses are temporally separated, as non-overlapping (see Fig. 1b, top and Methods). After this event, Msn2 and Mig1 exhibited sporadic pulsing that was unsynchronized between cells (Supplementary Video 1). During this steady-state period, we observed both overlapping (that is, coincident) events, in which Msn2 and Mig1 pulses overlap, as well as non-overlapping events in which Msn2, but not Mig1 localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1b, top and Methods).These data provoke two interrelated questions about whether and how relative pulse timing could function in combinatorial regulation (Fig. 1c): first, do inputs modulate the relative timing of transcription factor pulses, either during the transient response to a change in conditions, or during the subsequent period of repetitive pulsing? Second, if so, how does such pulse timing modulation affect downstream combinatorial gene regulation?To address these questions, we constructed strains containing synthetic target promoters incorporating binding sites for either or both transcription factors (Fig. 1a). These promoters drove expression of a transcriptional reporter consisting of 24 binding sites for a separately expressed PP7 RNA binding protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP)40 (Fig. 1a). These strains enabled us to simultaneously follow localization dynamics of Msn2 and Mig1 and downstream target expression in the same cell.Relative pulse timing in the transient responseWe first analysed transient responses to changes in various input conditions (that is, different Msn2 stressors) other than the known common input glucose (Fig. 2a). Addition of 100\u2009mM\u2009NaCl produced transient non-overlapping pulses of Msn2 and Mig1 in single cells and in population averages (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c, Supplementary Video 2) that were similar to those observed in the transient response to glucose reduction (Fig. 1b). Addition of 2.5% ethanol also activated both transcription factors. But in contrast to NaCl, it did so with overlapping, rather than non-overlapping, pulses (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 1d\u2013f, Supplementary Video 3). The difference in relative timing between NaCl and ethanol was also apparent in cross-correlation analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Together, these results indicate that distinct inputs can generate opposite relative timing in the transient responses of Msn2 and Mig1.Figure 2: Different inputs produce distinct transient gene expression responses by modulating relative pulse timing.a, Transient nuclear localization and gene expression responses were simultaneously monitored in individual cells. b, c, Addition of NaCl (100\u2009mM) or ethanol (2.5%) induced non-overlapping and overlapping responses, respectively. Green and red traces show mean Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization, respectively. d, e, Averaged single-cell transcriptional activity traces show that NaCl activated both combinatorial and Msn2-specific targets, while ethanol activated only the Msn2-specific target. Shading in b\u2013e indicates 95% confidence interval of the mean. f, qPCR data are consistent with single-cell data (b, c), and extend these responses to heat shock and H2O2 stresses (Extended Data Fig. 1h, i; see Methods). Error bars indicate s.e.m. calculated from 3\u20138 biological replicates.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageWe hypothesized that control of temporal overlap could provide a mechanism for combinatorial gene regulation. Non-overlapping pulse dynamics, in which the activator Msn2 is active, but the repressor Mig1 is not, could activate combinatorial target genes more efficiently than overlapping pulses, in which the two proteins are simultaneously bound to the same target promoter. Indeed, while both NaCl and ethanol led to activation of an Msn2-specific target promoter, only the non-overlapping dynamics of NaCl efficiently induced target expression (Fig. 2d, e, Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013f). Moreover, we observed similar timing-mediated regulation with other stresses. Heat shock and oxidative stress (from H2O2) induced non-overlapping and overlapping dynamics, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1h, i). As with the other stresses, both non-overlapping and overlapping dynamics activated an Msn2-specific target promoter, but only non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activated the combinatorial target promoter (Fig. 2f). As expected, the dependence of expression from the synthetic combinatorial target promoter on relative timing required both Msn2 and Mig1 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition, these effects were not specific to the synthetic target promoter, as expression of GSY1 (ref. 41), an endogenous target of Msn2 and Mig1, exhibited similar dependence on relative timing in response to stresses, as shown by both single-cell analysis and quantitative PCR data (Extended Data Fig. 2b\u2013e). In fact, further genome-wide analysis revealed 30 additional endogenous targets that exhibited a similar pattern of gene regulation during transient responses to NaCl and ethanol (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2f\u2013k, and Supplementary Discussion), suggesting that relative timing-dependent regulation applies to multiple endogenous target genes, as well as to the synthetic promoter. Together these data indicate that, during transient stress responses, cells regulate gene expression by modulating the relative pulse timing between Msn2 and Mig1.Regulation by relative pulse timing at steady-stateWe next asked whether relative pulse timing could also function in constant environmental conditions where both transcription factors pulse sporadically and repetitively. Because such pulsing is not synchronized among cells, it could only be analysed with single-cell movie data. We observed both overlapping and non-overlapping pulse events under constant conditions (Fig. 1b, Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 3a, b, and Supplementary Videos 4, 5). To better understand the effects of each type of event on gene expression, we adapted the technique of pulse-triggered averaging from neurobiology (usually called spike-triggered averaging)42 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We identified Msn2 pulses, and sorted them into two groups depending on whether or not a Mig1 pulse overlapped temporally with the Msn2 pulse (Fig. 3a, Methods). We then averaged the Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics over a time window around the Msn2 pulse peaks, for both overlapping and non-overlapping events. By construction, the resulting pulse-triggered averages showed opposite overall dynamic relationships between the two proteins (Fig. 3b, c).Figure 3: Pulse-triggered averaging reveals relative pulse timing-dependent gene expression under constant conditions, and modulation of relative timing by glucose concentration.a, Localization and target transcription dynamics in a single cell under constant (0.05%) glucose. Msn2 and Mig1 localization are shown in green and red, respectively, while transcriptional activity of their co-regulated target, GSY1 (GSY1-24xPP7SL) is shown in blue. Filmstrips show examples of non-overlapping and overlapping events (indicated by grey shading). White arrows on the upper filmstrip indicate active transcriptional sites for the target gene. Green and red horizontal lines below plot indicate identified Msn2 and Mig1 pulses. Green arrows indicate peaks of the Msn2 pulses used for pulse-triggered averaging (Methods). b, c, Pulse-triggered averages of Msn2 and Mig1 localization events sorted into non-overlapping (b, purple; n\u2009=\u200914,384 events) and overlapping (c, orange; n\u2009=\u20097,829 events) groups. d, e, Pulse-triggered average transcriptional activity traces for non-overlapping (d) and overlapping (e) events. Baseline activity (horizontal dashed line) was subtracted from each trace. Traces are aligned to the peak Msn2 pulse at t\u2009=\u20090 (vertical dashed line). f, Cross-correlation between Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics at different glucose levels (see also Extended Data Fig. 7g). g, Glucose levels modulate the percentage of Msn2 pulses that overlap with Mig1. Circles indicate measurements of pulse frequency (location of circle) and the percentage of Msn2 pulses that overlap with Mig1 (overlap fraction, colour of circle) for nine glucose levels (from 0.4% to 0.0125% as in Extended Data Fig. 8a). Horizontal contours indicate the overlap fraction expected at each glucose level assuming independent Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics (Methods). See also controls in Extended Data Fig. 8f, g. Shading indicates 95% confidence intervals of the mean.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imagePulse-triggered averaging enabled us to analyse the dependence of target gene expression on Msn2 pulsing and, more specifically, on its temporal relationship with Mig1, averaged over variability in both pulsing behaviour and downstream transcriptional responses (see Supplementary Discussion about the multiple layers of variability in this system). Both overlapping and non-overlapping pulses led to subsequent increase in the mean expression of the pure Msn2 synthetic target promoter (Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013c). However, only the non-overlapping events showed activation of the synthetic combinatorial Msn2-Mig1 promoter or the natural combinatorial target gene, GSY1 (Fig. 3d, e). Moreover, deletions of the zinc-finger DNA binding domains of either Msn2 or Mig1 eliminated the relative timing-dependence of GSY1 expression, indicating that DNA-binding of both proteins is necessary for relative timing-dependent regulation (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Together, these results show that relative timing between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses regulates gene expression under steady-state conditions.Thus far, we have simplified the analysis of relative pulse timing by classifying events as either overlapping or non-overlapping. However, cross-correlation analysis revealed more complexity in the dynamics. For example, we observed a peak at a positive time lag of \u223c2\u20134 min, corresponding to sequential activation of Msn2 followed by Mig1 (Extended Data Fig. 4f\u2013i, also evident in Fig. 3c, f; see Supplementary Discussion). More generally, the data showed a continuous distribution of time intervals between a given Msn2 pulse and its previous, or subsequent, Mig1 pulse. To better understand how these dynamics affect target gene expression, we analysed the dependence of mean expression level on the continuous time interval between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). Mean gene expression is minimal when Msn2 and Mig1 pulse simultaneously, but Mig1 pulses occurring within \u223c\u20094\u20135\u2009min before or after Msn2 pulses also suppress mean expression. These results are consistent with a model in which Mig1 pulses can both terminate continuing expression from preceding Msn2 pulses, and also establish promoter states with reduced tendency to activate in response to Msn2, possibly due to residual binding of Mig1 itself or to Mig1-induced effects on promoter states. As expected, these extended timing effects required both Msn2 and Mig1 binding sites on the target promoter, as well as DNA-binding activities of both proteins (Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). These characteristic timescales for Msn2-Mig1 pulse interactions establish the degree of simultaneity necessary for pulses to function as overlapping events.Modulation of relative pulse timingHaving established the effect of relative pulse timing on gene expression at steady-state, we next asked whether and how inputs affect relative timing. We acquired time-lapse movies of Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization across a range of constant glucose concentrations (from 0.4% to 0.0125%), where both Msn2 and Mig1 exhibited sporadic nuclear localization pulses (Extended Data Fig. 6, 7b\u2013e). The frequencies of pulses for both proteins, and the mean duration of Mig1 pulses, all varied systematically with glucose concentration (Extended Data Fig. 7a), while mean pulse amplitudes remained approximately constant (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Interestingly, however, averaged cross-correlations between Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization traces showed features (for example, the peak at time lag zero) that depended on glucose concentration (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, the percentage of Msn2 pulses that overlap with Mig1, which we define as the overlap fraction, changed systematically with glucose concentration (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Together, these results indicate that glucose concentration modulates the relative pulse timing between Msn2 and Mig1 at steady-state conditions.To better understand the effect of glucose concentration on relative pulse timing, it is helpful to distinguish between passive and active types of modulation. Passive modulation arises from changes in the frequency and/or duration of Mig1 pulses, and occurs even if Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics are independent. By contrast, active modulation would require mechanisms that specifically enhance or reduce the fraction of overlapping events.Passive modulation seems to dominate at lower glucose concentration, but both passive and active modulation occur at higher glucose concentrations. At very low glucose levels (<0.05%), the observed overlap fraction agreed with expectations based on passive modulation only (Methods, lower right of Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). However, at higher glucose levels (\u22650.05%), where pulse frequencies became less glucose-dependent (Extended Data Fig. 7a), the observed overlap fraction exceeded the value expected from passive modulation, and increased systematically with glucose concentration (upper left corner of Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8a), indicating a substantial role for active modulation. Moreover, including the active component of modulation improved the ability of a simple model to explain the dependence of target gene expression on glucose (Extended Data Fig. 8b\u2013d and Supplementary Discussion). We also found that relative pulse timing could be further modulated by other inputs such as NaCl and ethanol (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Discussion). These results show that, under steady-state conditions, input identity (type of stress) and level (for example, glucose concentration) together modulate relative pulse timing, through both passive and active mechanisms, to control target gene expression.Mechanism for relative pulse timing modulationRelative pulse timing modulation represents a distinct mode of gene regulation that operates in both steady-state and transient conditions (Fig. 4a, see also Supplementary Discussion). What mechanisms could enable cells to actively control relative pulse timing? One possibility involves regulatory components that specifically generate overlapping pulses of Msn2 and Mig1. Previous work has shown that Glc7, the catalytic component of PP1 phosphatase, can indirectly regulate both Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization43, making it a candidate for an active regulator of overlapping pulses (Extended Data Fig. 10a). We constructed a strain in which the wild-type GLC7 promoter was replaced with a Cu2+-inducible promoter in the native locus. In this strain, reducing expression of GLC7 below wild-type levels abolished active modulation, making the measured overlap fraction equal to that expected by chance (overlap of red solid and dashed lines in the left panel of Fig. 4b). This effect can also be seen in the Msn2-Mig1 cross-correlation at time lag zero, which is reduced at higher glucose concentrations (compare red and black lines in Fig. 4b, right). Restoring GLC7 expression close to wild-type levels restored active modulation (blue lines, Fig. 4b). Together, these data (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 10) support a role for Glc7 in active modulation by glucose (Supplementary Discussion). Other phospho-regulatory components may also contribute to active modulation in these and other conditions.Figure 4: Mechanistic aspect of relative pulse timing modulation.a, In gene regulation by relative pulse timing modulation (schematic), the identity and level of inputs (yellow and brown circles) regulate target gene expression through changes in the relative timing of Msn2 and Mig1 pulses (see Supplementary Discussion). Overlapping events (orange) only activate Msn2-specific targets while non-overlapping events (purple) activate both Msn2-specific and Msn2-Mig1 combinatorial targets. In steady-state (right), inputs modulate the fraction of Msn2 pulses that overlap with Mig1 (pie charts). b, GLC7 mediates active modulation of relative pulse timing, possibly by activating both Msn2 and Mig1 (schematic inset, left). Left, measured (solid line) and expected (dashed line) overlap fractions were plotted for three conditions: wild-type (black), reduced GLC7 expression (red), and the same strain with GLC7 expression restored to approximately wild-type levels (blue). Right, average cross-correlation between Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics for three glucose levels (percentages). Shading and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean.\nPowerPoint slide\nFull size imageDiscussionWhat functions could relative pulse timing modulation provide for the cell? One of the most fundamental concepts in combinatorial regulation is that cooperative interactions between transcription factors can increase their probability of simultaneous binding to a promoter, to implement cis-regulatory logic44. By controlling the fraction of time that two transcription factors are simultaneously active, relative pulse timing modulation could provide similar effects in trans (Supplementary Note and Extended Data Fig. 10f\u2013h). In addition to its functionality, a number of basic issues about timing-dependent regulation remain to be understood. For example, what accounts for variability among cells in their transcription factor dynamics and the apparently stochastic response of target promoters to those dynamics? What features of target promoters, such as the kinetic parameters that govern their activation, determine whether and how they respond to timing-based regulation?Relative timing between signals plays many important roles throughout science and engineering. In neuroscience, the relative timing of action potentials at pre- and post-synaptic neurons controls the strength of synaptic connectivity through spike-timing-dependent plasticity45. In communications, modulating the phase of a periodic signal relative to a reference signal is widely used to encode information46. Cells seem to have evolved a related strategy by encoding aspects of the extracellular environment in the relative timing with which different transcription factors pulse. The unsynchronized nature of these pulses (at steady-state) has made relative pulse timing modulation rather difficult to detect and characterize previously. However, pulsatile dynamics (both periodic and aperiodic) are now being discovered in a growing list of central signalling and regulatory pathways3,4,5, which are known to interact, or crosstalk, with one another. It will therefore be critical to more systematically map the temporal organization of cellular pathways, and determine principles that can explain both the mechanisms and functions of relative pulse timing modulation in living cells.MethodsStrain constructionStandard protocols were used for molecular cloning. Plasmids were replicated in either TOP10 or DH5\u03b1 Escherichia coli. Except where indicated, all yeast strains used in this study were constructed based on BY4741 (MATa his3 \u0394 0 leu2 \u0394 0 met15 \u0394 0 ura3 \u0394 0), where msn4, mig2, nrg1, nrg2 were further deleted (seamless deletion) or compromised (with auxotrophic or drug markers) to avoid complications resulting from these proteins binding to Msn2 or Mig1 binding sites. All yeast transformations were performed with standard lithium-acetate protocol47 or with Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo Research). Resulting constructs were confirmed with PCR and/or sequencing. Details of strain genotypes are listed in Supplementary Table 1.For endogenous gene fusion, MSN2-mKO2::LEU2 and MIG1-mCherry::spHIS5 were constructed by the fusion PCR approach where a PCR product comprised of 300\u2013500 bp of 3\u2032 end of target of interest, mKO2 or mCherry gene, LEU2 or spHIS5 cassette, and another 300\u2013500\u2009bp of the target downstream. More specifically, mCherry::spHIS5 was directly PCR amplified from pKT355 plasmid, mKO2 gene was obtained from Amalgaam Co., Ltd, and LEU2 was amplified from pRS315 plasmid. Fused PCR products were directly transformed. For RNA binding protein fusion PP7\u20132\u2009\u00d7\u2009GFP, pDZ276 plasmid (a gift from R. Singer) was directly used for transformation into yeast.Synthetic promoters driving either 24xPP7SL binding cassette (for single-cell 3-colour movies) or mKO2 (for qPCR measurements) are composed of the following elements: ADH1 terminator\u2013UAS\u2013basal HIS3 promoter (\u2212101 to \u22121 of HIS3 gene)\u201324xPP7SL cassette with ADH1 terminator or mKO2\u2013KANMAX or NATMX resistance cassette. ADH1 terminator and KANMX cassette were obtained from pKT vectors48. NATMX was obtained from pAG25 plasmid49. Basal HIS3 promoter was amplified from yeast genome. The 24xPP7SL cassette was obtained from Addgene (plasmid 31864). mKO2 was used for qPCR analysis because it is exogenous to yeast genome. Three different UAS cassettes contained one or both of the following elements: 4 copies of Msn2 binding motif (GATCTACAGCCCCTGGAAAAT, adopted from HSP12 promoter26) and/or 2 copies of Mig1 binding motif (AATAAAAATGCGGGGAA, adopted from SUC2 promoter50). These UAS cassettes were used to generate Msn2-specific, Mig1-specific, and Msn2-Mig1 combinatorial promoters. The entire constructs were flanked with sequences for integration into TRP1 locus of BY4741 and were assembled into a pKT based vector. The plasmids were digested with AfeI to release the entire cassette for integration into respective yeast strains. GSY1-24xPP7SL (for 3-colour movies) was generated by integration of 24xPP7SL::KANMX cassette directly downstream of the endogenous GSY1 gene.Zinc finger deletion mutants of Msn2 and Mig1 proteins were constructed by direct transformation of PCR fragments containing desired mutations. Specifically, a fused PCR product containing MIG1( \u0394 amino acid36-91)-mCherry::spHIS5 was used to generate Mig1\u2013mCherry with its DNA binding domain deleted. Similarly, a fused PCR product containing MSN2( \u0394 aa642-704)-mKO2::LEU2 was used for Msn2 zinc finger mutation. Deletion of Mig1 zinc finger appeared to impact its regulation of nuclear localization as the mutated Mig1\u2013mCherry became much more nuclear localized. This effect, however, does not affect our conclusions.Copper-inducible GLC7 strain was constructed by transforming a fusion PCR product of URA3-TEF terminator-CUP1 promoter flanked with sequences for integration to replace the endogenous GLC7 promoter. Transformants were selected on plates containing 100\u2009\u03bcM\u2009CuSO4.Media and growth conditionsWe adopted a minimal media formula with low auto-fluorescence for both culturing yeast cells and for microscopy8. Stock solutions for minerals (1,000\u00d7), vitamins (1,000\u00d7), as well as salts (50\u00d7) were made separately. Final working media was made by mixing these three components together with amino acid drop-out mix (from Clontech) and Milli-Q water. Media was adjusted to desired glucose concentration with a glucose stock (40%, w/v).For overnight liquid culture, single colonies of yeast were picked from agar plates made with minimal media and dispensed into 2\u20133\u2009ml of minimal media (2% glucose, \u2212Ura or \u2212His \u2212Leu \u2212Ura) in 14\u2009ml round-bottom polypropylene tubes (BD catalogue no. 352059). Cells were grown in a 30\u2009\u00b0C shaking incubator. The media and overnight culture procedures were the same for both single-cell microscopy and qPCR experiments. For microscopy, media was supplemented with 2\u2009mM sodium ascorbate (Sigma catalogue no. A7631) and 200\u2009\u03bcM trolox (Sigma catalogue no. 238812) (except for media with H2O2) to help reduce fluorescent protein photobleaching and photo toxicity to cells.Time-lapse microscopyAll time-lapse experiments were performed on an Olympus IX81 microscope with 60\u2009\u00d7 objective and hardware autofocus (ZDC2). Fluorescence was excited by a LED light source (Lumencor SOLA Light Engine) and collected onto a scientific CMOS camera (Andor Neo sCMOS) with a 2-by-2 bin setting. For mKO2 and mCherry, single z-plane images were acquired. For GFP, a 5-slice z-stack was acquired (0.8\u2009\u03bcm separation). The excitation and emission filters for mKO2, mCherry and GFP are: Ex 534/20 and Em 572/28, Ex 580/20 and Em 630/60, and Ex 472/30 and Em 535/50, respectively. The frame rate is 1\u2009frame\u2009min\u22121. Time-lapse movie automation was performed with Micro-Manager51. The entire microscope room was maintained at \u223c\u200926\u2009\u00b0C with two heater fans and a temperature controller (Omega Engineering catalogue no. FCH-FGC20012R and catalogue no. CSC32J).Movies were acquired for single cells cultured in a dual-inlet microfluidic channel (\u223c500\u2009\u03bcm wide), which enables media switching. The microfluidic device was fabricated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit (DOW Corning) and bonded with 24\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm glass coverslip (Gold Seal No. 1.5) after air-plasma cleaning (Harrick Plasma PDC-32G). The channels were cleaned by brief incubation with 2\u2009M\u2009NaOH, followed by washes with 100% ethanol and water. A 15\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 concanavalin A (Sigma catalogue no. C7275) solution was incubated in the channels for about 10\u2009min to coat the surface for adhering single yeast cells. Channels were washed with media before cell loading. Overnight yeast cultures were diluted back to OD600 nm\u2009=\u20090.1 with 2\u2009ml of fresh media (0.2% glucose, \u2212Ura) and were allowed to grow for another \u223c3\u2009h. Cells were briefly concentrated by centrifuge and loaded into the channel. Cells were incubated in the channels for 5\u2009min. The device was then loaded onto a sample stage on the microscope. Two inlets of a channel were connected with tubing (Weico Wire&Cable catalogue no. TT-30) to two different media solutions in 10\u2009ml syringes (BD catalogue no. 309604) containing different glucose or stimulant concentrations. These syringes were driven with separate syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 elite) which were controlled by Micro-Manager. Outlet of the channel was connected to a waste container. Media flow rate was maintained at 5\u2009\u03bcl\u2009min\u22121 throughout the movie except for during media change (at 50\u2009\u03bcl\u2009min\u22121 for 2\u2009min).The starting glucose concentration and the time before media switching differed in different experiments. For the transient glucose shift experiment (Fig. 1b), cells were in the channel with flowing 0.2% glucose media for more than 2\u2009h before switching to 0.1% glucose (acquisition of fluorescent images started 30\u2009min before switching). For experiments in Fig. 2, cells were in the channel with flowing 0.05% glucose media for more than 2\u2009h before switching to 0.05% glucose plus specified stressor. For steady-state experiments in Figs 3, 4, cells were in the channel with flowing 0.2% glucose media for at least 10\u2009min before switching to 0.05% or other designated glucose levels (from 0.4% to 0.0125%). Acquisition of fluorescent images started 110\u2009min after switching media conditions (that is, at steady-state). For cooper inducible GLC7 experiments (Fig. 4b), cells were cultured with minimal media without the addition of cooper until they were switched to a media containing 10\u2009\u03bcM\u2009CuSO4 for 110\u2009min before the acquisition of fluorescent images.Image analysis for extracting single-cell tracesSingle-cell traces were extracted from fluorescence images based on cell tracking performed on bright-field images. All analyses were implemented with custom Matlab code (with some modules obtained online as cited below). More specifically, a slightly defocused bright-field image was taken at each frame for segmentation and tracking purposes. Segmentation was performed by circular Hough transformation (CircularHough_Grd function from Mathworks File Exchange). Segmented cell masks were first aligned across the entire movie frames to roughly correct for x-y stage drift (in order to enhance tracking accuracy). The masks were then fed into a tracking algorithm (u-track52) to obtain final cell tracks. Tracks were examined manually, and those with errors were discarded and removed from further analysis. These filtered single-cell tracks were used to extract fluorescence traces.For analysis of, z-stack GFP images (for real-time transcription) we used a maximal intensity z-projection. Fluorescent images were then background subtracted (using background images acquired with media only) and corrected for field flatness caused by uneven illumination (using an image taken with fluorescein). Nuclear localization was calculated by the difference between the mean intensity of the top five pixels and the median intensity of all pixels. Single-cell nuclear localization traces for mKO2 and mCherry were then obtained with tracks obtained above. Real-time transcriptional activity (that is, PP7\u20132\u2009\u00d7\u2009GFP signal) was calculated as the intensity of the brightest pixel in the cell minus its local background. For the time when transcription is active, the brightest pixel coincides well with the transcription hotspot. Nuclear localization and transcriptional activity measurements were validated by manual examination of the extracted traces side-by-side with fluorescence images.Single-cell trace analysis and pulse-triggered averaging analysisSingle-cell traces were first baseline-subtracted and nuclear localization pulses were identified. These pulses were then characterized and used for pulse-triggered averaging analysis. More specifically, calculation of the baselines for mKO2 and mCherry traces was based on a measure for the degree of nuclear localization. In this method, pairwise spatial distance summed over the top 10 brightest pixels in individual cells was used to determine when the fluorescence signal is nuclear localized or not at a given frame. Nuclear localization scores from frames with the summed distance above a predefined threshold were used to estimate the baseline by a polynomial fit. For cases in which the baseline varied too much along a trace, baseline was estimated by fitting only the nuclear localization values that were below an empirically defined threshold. Baseline for GFP signal was estimated by polynomial fitting the GFP signals that were below an empirically defined threshold. Baseline subtraction procedures were validated by manual examination.Nuclear localization pulses were identified in both Msn2 and Mig1 traces. Pulse identification was based on iPeak (from Mathworks File Exchange). Shoulder peaks were filtered out and combined with neighbouring peaks (with higher amplitude). The remaining peaks were filtered based on an amplitude threshold (at least 20% above the baseline values) as well as the summed pairwise distance (below a predefined threshold). Width of the pulses was measured for left and right portions of the pulses separately (first fitted with spline and then measured at half of the pulse amplitude or the amplitude threshold, whichever is smaller). For pulse-triggered averaging analysis, a 21\u2009min window around the peak of each Msn2 pulse (that is, 10 min on each side) was used for classifying the relative timing. This time window was chosen based on the frequency of Msn2 pulses. Within this window, all Mig1 pulses were identified. If the peak of a triggered Msn2 pulse fell into the span (defined by pulse width) of a Mig1 pulse, it was classified as an overlapping event. Otherwise, it was classified as a non-overlapping event. A more detailed classification based on the distance between the peak of Msn2 pulse and the edge (defined by pulse width) of the Mig1 pulse (if multiple Mig1 pulses occur within the window, the one with maximum pulse amplitude was chosen for this classification) can also be done as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. Overlapping and non-overlapping events were averaged separately. Note that a larger time window (that is, a 26 min window with 10 min on the left of the peak and 15 min on the right) was chosen for averaging in Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs 4, 5 in order to capture and measure the prolonged transcriptional responses in the GFP dynamics.Cross-correlation analysisSeveral figures include cross-correlation analysis (Figs 3f, 4b and Extended Data Figs 1g, 7g and 9d). In these cases, we first compute the cross-correlation function for each cell in a given data set, and then average the resulting functions. Individual cross-correlations were based on mean-subtracted signals and normalized, computed using the following expression:  Here, angled brackets denote means, and  is the cross-correlation of  and  at time lag .Quantitative PCR analysisWe used qPCR analysis to validate the single-cell transcriptional response, with similar culture procedures for both microscopy and RNA analysis. In this protocol, cells were exposed to defined stimulants for 10\u2009min and RNA was extracted for two-step RT\u2013qPCR (reverse transcription followed by qPCR). Note that the concentrations of salt, ethanol, and H2O2 were doubled when compared to the microfluidic single-cell assay (that is, 200\u2009mM versus 100\u2009mM\u2009NaCl, 5% ethanol versus 2.5% ethanol, 0.5\u2009mM versus 0.25\u2009mM H2O2). Overnight cultures were diluted to OD600\u2009nm\u2009=\u20090.075 with 20\u2009ml of 0.2% glucose (\u2212Ura) in 250\u2009ml flask and allowed to grow until the OD600\u2009nm reached above 0.2 (about 3\u20134\u2009h). For transient stress experiments, cultures were then diluted back to OD600\u2009nm\u2009=\u20090.2 with 20\u2009ml of 0.05% glucose in 250\u2009ml flask and allowed to grow for another 2\u2009h. Cultures were split into 14\u2009ml polypropylene tubes (4\u2009ml each). Stresses were applied by mixing concentrated stock solutions (such as 5\u2009M\u2009NaCl, 100% ethanol, 0.83 M H2O2) with the culture or by moving the culture tubes to a 37\u2009\u00b0C shaking incubator (for heat shock). After precisely 10\u2009min of stress application, each culture was mixed with 6\u2009ml pre-chilled methanol (with dry ice/ethanol bath) in a 50\u2009ml tube to rapidly fix the cells. For steady-state experiments, cells were diluted to OD600 nm\u2009=\u20090.1 with 4\u2009ml fresh media of designated condition (different glucose concentration with or without additional CuSO4) in 50\u2009ml falcon tube. Cultures were allowed to grow for 2\u2009h and cells were mixed quickly with cold methanol as above. After >1\u2009h in cold methanol, cells were collected by centrifuging at 4\u2009\u00b0C and washed with ice cold water. Prior to performing standard RNA extraction protocols (with on-column DNase digestion) with RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen), cells were enzymatically treated with 100 \u03bcl of 2\u2009U\u2009\u03bcl\u22121 lyticase solution (Sigma catalogue no. L2524) for 10\u2009min at 30\u2009\u00b0C. The extracted RNA absorbance spectrum was analysed with NanoDrop and 1\u2009\u03bcg RNA was used for a standard 20\u2009\u03bcl iScript (Bio-Rad) reverse transcription reaction. The resulting cDNA was diluted 4\u00d7 with water before proceeding to qPCR reaction. A typical 10\u2009\u03bcl qPCR reaction was assembled with 5\u2009\u03bcl iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 2\u2009\u03bcl primers (1.5\u2009\u03bcM each), 2\u2009\u03bcl of cDNA, and 1\u2009\u03bcl of water. Reactions were performed on a CFX96 Real-Time machine (Bio-Rad). Each reaction had \u22652 technical replicates. Three reference genes were included (ACT1, UBC6, TFC1) for each sample. The latter two were based on recommendations by Teste et al.53. The mean Cq values of these reference genes were used for the calculation of \u0394\u0394Cq (or fold-change as 2-\u0394\u0394Cq) for each gene between sample and control. Calculations of \u0394\u0394Cq were done by CFX Manager Software (Bio-Rad) and final processing was performed by Matlab (Mathworks). Error bars were calculated by taking the standard errors of \u22653 biological replicates. Primers were designed according to manufacture instructions for iQ SYBR Green and were blasted against the yeast transcriptome (Primer-Blast54) to avoid nonspecific priming. The following primer sequences were used:ACT1_F: ACATCGTTATGTCCGGTGGT; ACT1_R: CATGGAAGATGGAGCCAAAG; UBC6_F: AGGACCTGCGGATACTCCTT; UBC6_R: TCTGATAGCCGGTGGTTTGT; TFC1_F: AGCGCTGGCACTCATATCTT; TFC1_R: TTGGGCGTATTCCACTGAAC; mKO2_F: GTGATCAAGCCCGAGATGAA; mKO2_R: CATCTCCTGATGTCCCTCGT; GSY1_F: ACTGGTTGATTGAGGGAGCA; GSY1_R: GACCATAGGTCAGCCTTCCA; EMI2_F: AATGGTGACGGAACCTTTGA; EMI2_R: GCGACCCAGGTAGCTAAACA; GLC3_F: CCGCTCCATAGGTGGTACTG; GLC3_R: ACTTCCCATCTCCCATTCATC; GPH1_F: TCTGGCCACCCATGAATTAG; GPH1_R: GCAACGCTCAGGACACTCTT; IGD1_F: AGCAATGGTAACAGCGCAAG; IGD1_R: CTCCAAACATGTGAAGCTGGT.RNA-Seq library construction and data analysisFor data shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, RNA-Seq was performed with libraries prepared from the RNA samples collected from cells of three different strains (no deletion strain and deletions of either msn2 or mig1) subjected to no treatment (control), 200\u2009mM\u2009NaCl, or 2.5% ethanol. For data shown in Extended Data Fig. 8d, RNA-Seq was performed with libraries prepared from the RNA samples collected from cells of the no deletion strain across 9 glucose concentrations and one msn2 deletion strain at 0.2% glucose. RNA sample preparation was similar to the descriptions in the previous section. Library was constructed according to standard Illumina protocols. Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 sequencer. Both library construction and sequencing were performed at the core sequencing facility at Caltech. For the transient experiments, two biological replicates for each sample collected on different days were sequenced and analysed. Analysis of the sequencing data was performed with a local instance of Galaxy55. A standard analysis pipeline was used (alignment with Tophat56). Statistical test of differential expression between conditions was performed with duplicates using DESeq257.Calculation of expected-by-chance fraction of overlapping pulsingThe heat map in Fig. 3g showed the expected fraction of Msn2 pulses that overlap with Mig1 pulses. This expected fraction measures the percentage of Msn2 pulses that would coincide with Mig1 pulses assuming the factors pulse independently of each other. Because an overlapping event is defined as when the peak of an Msn2 pulse falls into the time span of a Mig1 pulse, its expected fraction can be calculated as the fraction of time that Mig1 pulses occupy and is independent of Msn2 frequency, that is, . As shown in Extended Data Fig. 8a, this calculated expected-by-chance overlap fraction is almost identical to the measured overlap fraction from an artificial population of cells where Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics are scrambled to enforce independence.Fitting gene expression data with different modelsIn Extended Data Fig. 8b\u2013d, we compared the ability of three models to fit combinatorial target gene expression levels across a range of glucose concentrations. The first model (\u2018active\u2013passive\u2019) includes both active and passive modulation, the second model (\u2018passive only\u2019) includes only passive modulation, that is, assumes independent Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics, and the third model (\u2018Msn2 only\u2019) assumes Mig1 does not reduce the effect of the Msn2 pulses (see Supplementary Discussion). In all models, gene expression is assumed to be activated by Msn2 and also occur at a basal level in the absence of nuclear Msn2. Mig1 is assumed to suppress both Msn2-activated (except in the Msn2 only model), and basal expression. In these models, expression is thus proportional to the frequency of effective Msn2 pulses (those not suppressed by Mig1 pulses, see definition below), plus the promoter-specific basal activity:  Here, i labels the glucose condition; a denotes the mean amount of gene expression produced by each effective Msn2 pulse;  is the frequency of effective Msn2 pulses per hour (calculated based on single-cell data, see details below); b is the basal promoter activity when Mig1 is out of the nucleus; and  is the fraction of time that Mig1 is out of the nucleus (also calculated based on single-cell data). Note that the three models differ only in the effective Msn2 pulse frequency. In general, the active-passive model has the lowest , because in this model Mig1 pulses suppress the effects of Msn2 pulses even more frequently than expected if Msn2 and Mig1 were independent, that is, in the \u2018passive only\u2019 model. In contrast, the \u2018Msn2 only\u2019 model has the highest .We calculated the effective Msn2 frequency, , with two different levels of temporal precision (see Supplementary Discussion). The simpler binary relative timing model considers Msn2 pulses to be either overlapping or non-overlapping with Mig1, as in Fig. 3. By contrast, the more precise continuous relative timing model allows for the empirically observed continuous dependence of expression level on the time interval between the Msn2 and Mig1 pulses, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5b.In the binary model, the effective Msn2 pulse frequency is simply the frequency of non-overlapping Msn2 pulses (Fig. 3). In the continuous model, the effect of an observed Msn2 pulse on a natural target\u2019s gene expression was determined by its pulse timing relative to Mig1 using the results in Extended Data Fig. 5b. More specifically, we normalized the data in Extended Data Fig. 5b such that Msn2 only pulses (those at the longest absolute time intervals) have a relative expression level of 1, while overlapping Msn2 pulses (time interval 0) have a relative expression level of 0. For each observed Msn2 pulse we calculated an effective gene expression contribution based on its timing relative to Mig1. This calculation was performed across all traces and all glucose concentrations to obtain . Prior to fitting, we converted the relative qPCR expression data to an absolute scale (equivalent to FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) using the RNA-seq data at 0.05% glucose as a reference (Extended Data Fig. 2f). We also used RNA-seq data from an msn2 mutant to independently estimate parameter b. Thus, for each of the three models, only the parameter a needs to be fit. The least-squares fitting was performed by minimizing the error function , where  denotes the experimentally measured gene expression levels at glucose level i from qPCR and RNA-seq data sets.Statistical analysisTo compare single-cell data between different conditions, we computed the 95% confidence intervals of the sample mean for each set of single cells by the bootstrap method. More specifically, resampling with replacement was implemented with Matlab and 2,000 resamplings of the same sample size were obtained for each set of single cells. These 2,000 sets of single-cell data were then used for downstream analysis such as pulse-triggered averaging analysis and others. Bias-corrected 95% confidence interval58 of the 2,000 samples were then calculated and represented as error bars or shaded regions. To compare distributions, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used.No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\n\nAccession codes\nPrimary accessions\nGene Expression Omnibus\n\n\nGSE71712\n\n\n\nData deposits\nRNA-Seq data have been deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession code GSE71712.\nReferencesAlon, U.

(see Fig. 2b, c).Extended Data Figure 2 Additional data and analysis for transient stress responses.a, Fold-change in expression in response to different stresses for synthetic combinatorial target gene for three genetic backgrounds: no deletion (MSN2 MIG1, data from Fig. 2f), msn2 deletion, and mig1 deletion. b, Similar plot for the endogenous target gene GSY1. Cells were treated with designated stress for 10\u2009min and\u2009\u2265\u20093 biological replicates were averaged (error bar indicates s.e.m.). P value was obtained from two-tailed t-test. c, d, Averaged transcriptional responses of GSY1-24xPP7 in response to 100\u2009mM NaCl (c) or 2.5% ethanol (d) for three genetic backgrounds: no deletion, mig1 deletion, and msn2 deletion. Averaged nuclear localization traces of Msn2\u2013mKO2 and Mig1\u2013mCherry for the \u2018no deletion\u2019 strain are shown on the top panels. e, Averaged nuclear localization traces of Msn2\u2013mKO2 and Mig1\u2013mCherry (top) and corresponding transcriptional responses for GSY1-24xPP7 in response to glucose downshift (from 0.2% to 0.1%). Shading in c\u2013e indicates 95% confidence intervals of the mean. f\u2013k, RNA-seq analysis (see Methods and Supplementary Discussion for more details). f, log2 fold-changes (LFC) in gene expression of 31 identified combinatorial targets (including GSY1; brown circle, indicated by green arrow) in response to NaCl (x axis) and ethanol (y axis) for wild-type background (that is, no deletion of either MSN2 or MIG1). g, The differences in LFC between wild-type and mig1 deletion for both NaCl (x axis) and ethanol (y axis). h, The differences in LFC between wild-type and msn2 deletion for both NaCl (x axis) and ethanol (y axis). i, The effect of Msn2 for each target was plotted against the corresponding number of Msn2 binding sites. j, Analogous plot for the effect of Mig1 binding sites. k, Correlation coefficients between the effect of Msn2 or Mig1 and the number of Msn2 or Mig1 binding motif, respectively. Error bars in f\u2013h indicate standard deviations from two biological replicates. Error bars in k represent 95% confidence intervals from bootstrap.Extended Data Figure 3 Example 3-colour single-cell traces under steady-state conditions, and schematic diagram of pulse-triggered averaging analysis.a, b, Example 3-colour single-cell traces for synthetic (a) and natural (b) promoters under constant glucose (0.05%). Two cells are shown for each promoter. For each cell, nuclear localization traces are shown on the top and PP7\u20132\u2009\u00d7\u2009GFP transcriptional output signal is shown on the bottom. c, Schematic illustration of pulse-triggered averaging analysis. Msn2 pulses were identified (green arrows) and sorted based on their relationship with the Mig1 signal within a 21\u2009min time window (see Methods). Horizontal green and red lines underneath top time trace plot indicate width of identified Msn2 and Mig1 pulses, respectively. Msn2 pulses whose peaks overlap with Mig1 pulses were categorized as overlapping events (orange arrows) while the rest of Msn2 pulses were categorized as non-overlapping events (purple arrows). Overlapping and non-overlapping events were then averaged separately (bottom schematics).Extended Data Figure 4 Pulse-triggered averaging analysis for control promoters and for delayed pulse timing events.a, b, Plots analogous to those in Fig. 3d, e for additional synthetic and natural promoters. The GSY1 promoter was examined in strains with Msn2 or Mig1 zinc-finger deletions. For gene expression, areas under curves were analysed and presented in c, d. c, Relative pulse timing-dependent gene expression occurs for combinatorial promoters but not pure Msn2 or Mig1 target promoters. Bars represent integrated gene expression based on area under curve from Fig. 3d, e and a, b. d, Plot analogous to c for the natural GSY1 target gene. Binding of the transcription factors was abolished by mutations in zinc finger DNA-binding domains, indicated by crosses. e, Distributions of gene expression (estimated as integrated area under curve) per non-overlapping or overlapping event for both synthetic and natural combinatorial promoters (real data (solid) versus control data (dashed); top) and ratios between real and control data (bottom). Control data was measured from scrambled population of cells. For the real data, the distributions of non-overlapping and overlapping events are significantly different (by Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test) with P values of 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221217 and 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221215 for synthetic and natural promoters, respectively. In contrast, for control data, they are not significantly different (P values: 0.4520 and 0.9888). For the calculation of ratios, averages of the non-overlapping and overlapping control data were used as control. f\u2013i, Pulse-triggered averaging analysis of \u2018delayed\u2019 events in which an Msn2 pulse is followed by a Mig1 pulse (see Supplementary Discussion for details). f, Overlapping events were subdivided into delayed and non-delayed depending, as shown. Corresponding mean Msn2 and Mig1 signals as well as transcriptional responses were plotted for both synthetic and natural promoters. A similar classification was performed for non-overlapping events (g). Area under curve for f, g was plotted for direct comparison of gene expression between delayed and non-delayed pulse timing events (h, i). Shading and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean. Schematic promoters indicate whether the synthetic or natural GSY1 promoter were used in each case.Extended Data Figure 5 Analysis of mean gene expression dependence on time interval (continuous relative timing) between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses.a, b, Mean expression from both synthetic (a) and natural (b) target promoters depends on the time interval between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses (that is, interval between the peak of an Msn2 pulse and the edge of the nearest Mig1 pulse). For each time interval, mean expression values were determined by integrating the area under the baseline-subtracted averaged PP7 traces, and averaging within bins of similar pulse interval. c, Specifically, Msn2 pulses were categorized on the basis of the pulse interval between Msn2 and Mig1 and the corresponding PP7 signals were averaged and their areas under curve were plotted (Methods). The pulse interval ranges from \u22129 to 9\u2009min, which represents the bin centre of each 2-min bin (for example, 1\u2009min represents the range 2\u2009min\u2009\u2265\u2009interval\u2009>\u20090\u2009min), with the 0 min interval representing overlapping events. Both >10 or <\u221210\u2009min intervals represent events where Msn2 pulses were not surrounded by any Mig1 pulses within 21\u2009min. d, e, Msn2 and Mig1 regulation are both necessary for continuous relative timing-dependent gene expression under constant glucose condition. Analysis similar to a, b was performed on synthetic Msn2- and Mig1-specific promoters (d) and natural GSY1 promoter with Msn2 or Mig1 zinc finger deletion mutants (e). Shading and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean.Extended Data Figure 6 Example single-cell nuclear localization traces for different constant glucose conditions.Two single-cell traces are shown for each indicated glucose level (boxed percentage values). Cells were switched to indicated glucose level from 0.2% glucose at 110 min before time zero (that is, beginning of movie acquisition).Extended Data Figure 7 Characterization of Msn2 and Mig1 pulses and average cross-correlation functions between Msn2 and Mig1 in individual cells across different constant glucose concentrations.a, Pulse frequency, amplitude, and duration analysis. Single-cell traces at each glucose level were analysed and the mean frequency, amplitude and duration for both Msn2 and Mig1 were plotted. b, c, Distributions of total number of pulses per trace across glucose concentrations (b), along with corresponding fits to Poisson distributions (shown as cumulative distributions, c). Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) tests showed that these distributions differ significantly from Poisson distributions (P\u2009<\u200910\u221216). d, e, Analogous plots for the distributions of inter-pulse time intervals (d), and corresponding fits to exponential distributions (e). These distributions differ significantly from exponential distributions according to KS tests (P\u2009<\u200910\u221257). f, Distributions of pulse duration for Msn2 and Mig1 across glucose concentrations. g, Cross-correlation function (solid blue) of Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization traces, that is, cross-corr(Msn2, Mig1) (Methods). Dashed blue lines represent negative (independent) controls, calculated by scrambling the Msn2-Mig1 trace pairs within a population of cells (that is, cross-correlating Msn2 from one cell with Mig1 from another, randomly chosen, cell). Shading and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean. The number of cells analysed in each glucose concentration: 1,511 (0.4%), 3,475 (0.2%), 2,605 (0.15%), 2,075 (0.1%), 3,034 (0.075%), 2,768 (0.05%), 1,392 (0.025%), 2,055 (0.02%), and 1,906 (0.0125%). h, Two different localization metrics show similar Msn2 and Mig1 state distributions. Top left, histogram of the intensity score for Msn2 and Mig1 shows long-tailed distributions for both proteins with peaks around zero (basal state). Insert, zoomed-in view of the tails. Top right, analogous plots for the signal proximity score also show long-tailed distributions with clear basal states. Signal proximity is the inverse of the distance-based localization metric described in the Methods section. High signal proximity indicates that the top 10 brightest pixels in the cell are close to each other. (Bottom) Signal intensity positively correlates with signal proximity for both Msn2 and Mig1, suggesting that these two independent scores show related features. This data are for cells at 0.05% glucose. Similar behaviours are observed across other glucose concentrations.Extended Data Figure 8 Further characterization of relative pulse timing modulation under steady-state conditions.a, Left, experimentally measured overlapping fraction (solid black) can be compared to minimum and maximum possible overlapping fractions (bottom and top dashed lines, respectively). The expected overlapping fraction for independent Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics is determined two ways: either computed from the Mig1 duty cycle (dashed black), or measured from scrambled populations (dashed red). Minimum and maximum possible fractions were calculated with the measured duty cycles of Msn2 and Mig1 pulses. Right, the ratios of measured overlapping fraction to expected overlapping fraction across glucose concentrations. b, Relative pulse timing modulation explains gene-expression dependence on glucose level for combinatorial target promoters. Black circles represent mean expression of 5 genes measured by qPCR (see Methods for normalization). Data were fit with three models, as indicated. See Methods and Supplementary Discussion for more details on binary and continuous timing models. R2 values for fits are indicated in corresponding colours. Error bars indicate s.e.m. calculated from 3 biological replicates. c, Expression data for the 5 individual genes fit to the binary timing (dashed lines; R2 values in dashed box) as well as continuous timing (solid lines; R2 values in solid box) models. d, Analysis of RNA-seq expression data across 9 glucose concentrations. The averaged expression levels from 28 of the 31 identified combinatorial targets (Extended Data Fig. 2f\u2013k) were fit with the binary or continuous timing modulation models (left and right plots, respectively). Three genes were excluded because they did not display a monotonic dependence on glucose (YER067C-A, YKR098C, YLR109W). In this analysis, parameter b was independently estimated from an msn2 mutant at 0.2% glucose (samples collected on the same day). e, Glucose level modulates the fraction of delayed pulse timing events (see also Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Discussion). Total fractions of delayed overlapping (see Extended Data Fig. 4e, left) and delayed non-overlapping pulse events (see Extended Data Fig. 4f, left) were plotted across glucose concentrations. Expected fractions were computed from \u2018scrambled\u2019 populations where Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics are, by construction, independent. f, g, Glucose concentration also modulates relative pulse timing in a control strain without deletions of msn4 and mig2. f, Pulse characteristics of both Msn2 and Mig1 for varying glucose concentrations. g, Measured versus expected overlapping fractions across different glucose concentrations (see a) for the wild-type background that was not deleted for Msn4 and Mig2. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean (except for b\u2013d). The number of cells analysed for f, g: 618 (0.4%), 541 (0.2%), 714 (0.025%), and 775 (0.0125%).Extended Data Figure 9 Additional effects of stress level and type on transient and steady-state responses.a, Stress level does not modulate relative pulse timing during transient responses. Averaged nuclear localization traces of Msn2\u2013mKO2 and Mig1\u2013mCherry during transient response to 50\u2009mM\u2009NaCl (left) or 1.25% ethanol (right) are shown (see Fig. 2b, c). b, Additional stresses modulate relative timing during steady-state responses. Changes in pulse characteristics of both Msn2 and Mig1 in response to the addition of 100\u2009mM\u2009NaCl or 2.5% ethanol during steady-state growth at 0.05% glucose. c, Measured (black) versus expected (grey) overlapping fractions for the same 3 conditions as in b. d, Averaged cross-correlation between Msn2 and Mig1 time traces for the same three conditions. See Supplementary Discussion for additional discussion. Shading and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean. The number of cells analysed for b, d: 2,768 (0.05% glucose), 2,178 (0.05% glucose with 100\u2009mM\u2009NaCl) and 2,115 (0.05% glucose with 2.5% ethanol).Extended Data Figure 10 A role for Glc7 in active relative pulse timing modulation under constant glucose conditions and functional aspect of relative pulse timing modulation.a, Schematic of potential mechanisms for Glc7-dependent relative pulse timing modulation (top) and construct design (bottom). Overlapping pulsing of Msn2 and Mig1 could be induced by either a common kinase/phosphatase (such as Glc7) that directly or indirectly activates both Msn2 and Mig1 localization, or by an upstream input (yellow circle) that simultaneously regulates kinases/phosphatases responsible for Msn2 and Mig1 localization. To analyse the role of GLC7 in relative pulse timing, we constructed a strain in which the normal GLC7 promoter is replaced by a copper-inducible promoter, as shown. b, qPCR characterization of the inducible GLC7 strain across three glucose concentrations. Basal copper level in the media reduced GLC7 expression to less than 50% of its wild-type level. Addition of 10\u2009\u03bcM\u2009CuSO4 restored the expression to 110% to 140% of wild-type level. c, Changes in pulse characteristics in response to GLC7 reduction (red) and restoration (blue), compared to wild-type (black). d, Corresponding changes in pulse interval distribution. Pulse interval was calculated as the distance between the peak of a given Msn2 pulse and the peak of its closest Mig1 pulse within a 21\u2009min window. e, Averaged nuclear localization traces of Msn2\u2013mKO2 (green) and Mig1\u2013mCherry (red) in response to 2.5% ethanol addition (dashed line) for the GLC7 reduction mutant. See Supplementary Discussion for additional discussion. Error bars in b indicate s.e.m. from 3 biological replicates. For c\u2013e, shading and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean. The number of cells analysed in the mutant strain: 671 (0.2% glucose without Cu2+), 540 (0.1% glucose without Cu2+), 719 (0.025% glucose without Cu2+), 756 (0.2% glucose with Cu2+), 643 (0.1% glucose with Cu2+), and 656 (0.025% glucose with Cu2+). f\u2013h, Functional aspect of relative pulse timing modulation (see Supplementary Note). f, Concentration-based versus time-based regulation. Input modulates the regulator concentration (left) versus the fraction of regulator ON time (right). g, Modulation of relative pulse timing in time-based regulation results in changes in the effective protein\u2013protein cooperativity. Increasing protein\u2013protein cooperativity in concentration-based regulation changes the probability of co-binding of TFA and TFB (left). Increasing overlapping pulsing in time-based regulation leads to qualitatively similar changes in the probability of co-binding (right). Protein cooperativity parameter \u03c9AB was increased from 1 to 2 for the left plots. Overlap fraction was increased from \u03b8A\u03b8B to 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u03b8A\u03b8B for the right plots (\u03c9AB\u2009=\u20091). KA\u2009=\u2009KB\u2009=\u20095 for both left and right. h, Schematic, relative pulse timing modulation affects the relative probability of simultaneous binding of two transcription factors to a target promoter (right). This effect is analogous to that generated by cooperative protein\u2013protein interactions (left)44. Stronger protein\u2013protein interactions or a higher overlap fraction can both increase the probability with which two transcription factors will be simultaneously bound at neighbouring sites (schematic pie charts).Supplementary informationSupplementary InformationThis file contains a Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Note, Supplementary References and Supplementary Table 1.

Now Michael Elowitz and colleagues use single-cell videos to show that yeast cells modulate the relative timing between the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 \u2014 a gene activator and a repressor, respectively \u2014 to control the expression of target genes in response to diverse environmental conditions. They also demonstrate that yeast cells respond to various concentrations of glucose by actively modulating the fraction of overlapping Msn2 and Mig1 pulses and regulate target gene expression accordingly.show all\n\n\nAssociated Content\n\n\n\n\n\nExpression feels two pulses\n\n\nAntoine BaudrimontAttila Becskei\n\n\nNature\nNews & Views\n14 Oct 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSectionsFiguresReferencesAbstractMainTwo stages of dynamic pulsingRelative pulse timing in the transient responseRegulation by relative pulse timing at steady-stateModulation of relative pulse timingMechanism for relative pulse timing modulationDiscussionMethodsAccession codesReferencesAcknowledgementsAuthor informationEthics declarationsExtended data figures and tablesSupplementary informationPowerPoint slidesRights and permissionsAbout this articleThis article is cited byComments\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temporally structured pulsing of transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 in response to glucose reduction.View in articleFull size imageFigure 2: Different inputs produce distinct transient gene expression responses by modulating relative pulse timing.View in articleFull size imageFigure 3: Pulse-triggered averaging reveals relative pulse timing-dependent gene expression under constant conditions, and modulation of relative timing by glucose concentration.View in articleFull size imageFigure 4: Mechanistic aspect of relative pulse timing modulation.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 1 Single-cell analysis of relative pulse timing modulation by stress identity during transient response.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 2 Additional data and analysis for transient stress responses.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 3 Example 3-colour single-cell traces under steady-state conditions, and schematic diagram of pulse-triggered averaging analysis.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 4 Pulse-triggered averaging analysis for control promoters and for delayed pulse timing events.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 5 Analysis of mean gene expression dependence on time interval (continuous relative timing) between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 6 Example single-cell nuclear localization traces for different constant glucose conditions.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 7 Characterization of Msn2 and Mig1 pulses and average cross-correlation functions between Msn2 and Mig1 in individual cells across different constant glucose concentrations.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 8 Further characterization of relative pulse timing modulation under steady-state conditions.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 9 Additional effects of stress level and type on transient and steady-state responses.View in articleFull size imageExtended Data Figure 10 A role for Glc7 in active relative pulse timing modulation under constant glucose conditions and functional aspect of relative pulse timing modulation.View in articleFull size image\nAlon, U.

Because individual cells appear to be highly variable at all these levels5, it is essential to map different modalities in the same cells. Here we report the imaging of 3,660 chromosomal loci in single mouse embryonic stem\u00a0(ES) cells using DNA seqFISH+, along with 17 chromatin marks and subnuclear structures by sequential immunofluorescence and the expression profile of 70 RNAs. Many loci were invariably associated with immunofluorescence marks in single mouse ES cells. These loci form \u2018fixed points\u2019 in the nuclear organizations of single cells and often appear on the surfaces of nuclear bodies and zones defined by combinatorial chromatin marks. Furthermore, highly expressed genes appear to be pre-positioned to active nuclear zones, independent of bursting dynamics in single cells. Our analysis also uncovered several distinct mouse ES cell subpopulations with characteristic combinatorial chromatin states. Using clonal analysis, we show that the global levels of some chromatin marks, such as H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and macroH2A1 (mH2A1), are heritable over at least 3\u20134 generations, whereas other marks fluctuate on a faster time scale. This seqFISH+-based spatial multimodal approach can be used to explore nuclear organization and cell states in diverse biological systems.\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have full access to this article via Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\nDownload PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainThe main approaches to examine nuclear organization have been sequencing-based genomics and microscopy1,3. Genomics approaches, such as Hi-C6 and SPRITE7, have been powerful in mapping interactions between chromosomes across the genome and have been scaled down to the single-cell level1,3. However, reconstructing 3D structures from the measured interactions relies on computational models, and it is difficult to integrate multiple modalities of measurements2,4, including chromosome structures, in the same cells. However, microscopy-based methods can directly image chromosomes and nuclear bodies1,3. Recently reported methods8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 using Oligopaint16 and sequential DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (DNA FISH) have enabled imaging of many DNA loci in single cells. These studies have shown that chromosome organization is highly heterogeneous at the single-cell level8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, such as in the variability of chromosome folding even between two alleles in single cells8,9,10,12,15. To further discover organizational principles at the single-cell level, we need integrated tools to image chromosomes as well as nuclear bodies and chromatin marks that are aligned precisely in the same cells.DNA seqFISH+ imaging in single cellsBuilding on seqFISH17,18,19,20,21 and other multiplexed FISH methods8,9,10,11,13,16,22, we have developed DNA seqFISH+ to target 3,660 loci in single mouse ES cells (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Table 1, 2). In two of the fluorescent channels, we used a seqFISH+ coding scheme (Methods) to target 1,267 loci approximately 2\u00a0Mb apart (Fig. 1b, c) and 1,193 loci at the 5\u2032 end of genes. Together, these two channels labelled 2,460 loci spaced approximately 1\u00a0Mb apart across the whole genome. The third fluorescent channel targeted 60 consecutive loci at 25-kb resolution on each of the 20 chromosomes for an additional 1,200 loci (Fig. 1b, d). These approaches enabled us to examine nuclei at both 1-Mb resolution for the entire genome, and 25-kb resolution for 20 distinct regions that are at least 1.5\u00a0Mb in size (Fig. 1e).Fig. 1: DNA seqFISH+ imaging of chromosomes.a, Schematic for DNA seqFISH+ combined with RNA seqFISH and sequential immunofluorescence (Methods). b, Example images of DNA seqFISH+ in a mouse ES cell.

In i, H3K27ac enrichments of the entire region are obtained from ChIP\u2013seq24. n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells in 2 biological replicates (f\u2013i).Full size imageDNA seqFISH+ detected 5,616.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01,551.4 (median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) dots per cell in total, with 1-Mb and 25-kb resolution data (Extended Data Fig. 2h\u2013k) in 446 cells from two biological replicates. This corresponds to an estimated detection efficiency of at least 50% in the diploid genome considering the cell cycle phases (Methods). We also detected 14.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 false-positive dots per cell (median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.), as determined by the barcodes unused in the codebook.Imaged chromosomes in single cells showed clear physical territories for individual chromosomes and variable structures among cells and chromosomes (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 3, 4). The DNA seqFISH+ measurements were highly reproducible between biological replicates (Extended Data Fig. 2l, m), and agreed with population Hi-C23 and SPRITE data7 (Fig. 1f, g, Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013g). The genomic distance versus physical distance scaling relationships for each chromosome differ among the chromosomes at 1-Mb resolution as well as at 25-kb resolution (Fig. 1h, i, Extended Data Fig. 4c, d), showing that regions with low H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) marks24 tend to have more compact spatial organization (Fig. 1i), possibly owing to different underlying epigenetic states25.Integrated measurements in single cellsWe integrated our analysis of the genome (DNA seqFISH+) with the transcripts (RNA seqFISH) as well as histone modifications and subnuclear structures (sequential immunofluorescence) (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a). Seventeen primary antibodies targeting nuclear lamina26, nuclear speckle27, nucleolus28 and active and repressive histone modification markers29 were conjugated with DNA oligonucleotides30,31, enabling the selective readout of individual primary antibodies with fluorescently labelled readout probes (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Figs. 1a, 2f, g, 5). These antibodies and RNA FISH probes for 70 messenger RNA and intron species were hybridized in the same cells as the DNA seqFISH+ probes. Additionally, four repetitive regions that relate to nuclear organization32,33 were sequentially imaged with DNA FISH (Extended Data Fig. 5a).Fig. 2: DNA seqFISH+ combined with sequential immunofluorescence reveals invariant features.a, DAPI and immunostaining in a mouse ES cell nucleus.

Each bin represents an imaging locus from 1-Mb resolution DNA seqFISH+ (n\u00a0=\u00a02,460 loci). n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells from 2 biological replicates (c\u2013h).Full size imageWe extensively optimized the combined protocols (Extended Data Fig. 1a, 2a\u2013g, Methods) to profile these different modalities and accurately align between immunofluorescence and DNA FISH images for more than 130 rounds of hybridizations on an automated confocal microscope.Repressive histone marks (for example, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3) colocalized with DAPI-rich regions and minor satellite DNA (MinSat) corresponded to pericentromeric and centromeric heterochromatin32,33 (Fig. 2b left, Extended Data Fig. 5d). Immunofluorescence of RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on Ser5 (RNAPII(Ser5P)) and active marks (H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and H3K27ac) localized to the periphery of nuclear speckles (SF3A66) (Fig. 2b middle, Extended Data Fig. 5d) and were excluded from both heterochromatic regions and the nuclear lamina (Extended Data Fig. 5d), consistent with previously reported localization patterns27,34. We also note that chromosomes 12, 16, 18 and 19, which contain ribosomal DNA repeat sequence (rDNA) arrays7, showed significant association with the nucleoli (Fig. 2b right, Extended Data Fig. 5d).Fixed loci are consistent in single cellsFrom the integrated multiplexed immunofluorescence and DNA seqFISH+ data, we systematically calculated the physical distances between each DNA locus and the nearest \u2018hot\u2019 immunofluorescence voxel, defined by being two\u00a0s.d. above the mean value for each immunofluorescence marker (Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). Because many immunofluorescence markers form discrete globules in the nucleus, we also calculated the distance of each DNA locus from the exterior of immunofluorescent nuclear bodies (Methods), and confirmed that both metrics are highly correlated (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f).We generated a \u2018chromatin profile\u2019 by counting the fraction of time each DNA locus is within 300\u00a0nm of the surface of an immunofluorescence mark (Fig. 2c, d, Extended Data Figs. 5g, 6, 7), the resolution of the diffraction-limited immunofluorescence images. Notably, these chromatin profiles were strongly correlated with chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing24 (ChIP\u2013seq), DamID35 and SPRITE7 datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b) with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.90 (H3K9ac), 0.82 (H3K27ac), 0.49 (lamin B1), 0.75 (SF3A66) and 0.77 (fibrillarin). The good agreement at 1-Mb resolution between the imaging data and the ChIP\u2013seq data suggests that proximity to nuclear bodies may\u00a0have an extensive role in regulating the chromatin states of DNA loci.At the single-cell level, many DNA loci appear consistently close to particular immunofluorescence marks in a large percentage of cells (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 6f). For example, the locus of the Pou5f1 (also known as Oct4), a master regulator of pluripotency, appeared to be close to the exterior of H3K9ac globules in 77.2% of the cells, and Eef2, a housekeeping gene, was close to nuclear speckles in 85.2% of the cells (Supplementary Table 3). We set a threshold of two\u00a0s.d. above the mean to highlight the loci with the most consistent interactions. Those fixed loci for each immunofluorescence marker, either active nuclear marks (for example, SF3A66 and H3K9ac) or repressive marks (for example, H3 lysine 9 and lysine 27 methylation (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3)) (Fig. 2e\u2013g, Extended Data Fig. 6g-i), consistently appeared on the exterior of the respective markers.The presence of fixed loci for different immunofluorescence markers on the same chromosome (Fig. 2f\u2013h, Extended Data Fig. 6h, i) further constrains the organization of the chromosomes. For example, chromosome 4 contained fixed loci associated with the heterochromatic marker H3K9me3 and fixed loci for the nuclear speckle protein SF3A66 (Fig. 2g, h, Extended Data Fig. 6i). Correspondingly, in 96.2% of cells, we observed chromosome 4 spanning heterochromatic globules and nuclear speckles (Supplementary Table 3). Each chromosome contains a unique combination of fixed immunofluorescent mark loci (Fig. 2h), and corresponds to the association between the chromosome and nuclear bodies consistently in single cells (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 6i). Previous studies7,36,37 have explored nuclear lamina, speckle and nucleolus as deterministic scaffolds for chromosome organization. Our results extend these findings in single cells. Together, despite the variability in appearance in the single cell chromosome structures and nuclear body positioning5, there are invariant features across multiple DNA\u2013nuclear body associations that give rise to the organization of the nucleus in single cells.Combinatorial marks define nuclear zonesWe clustered individual binned voxels38 on the basis of their combinatorial chromatin profiles and obtained 12 major clusters (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013e). Some of these clusters or nuclear zones (Fig. 3a, b) corresponded to nuclear bodies such as the nuclear speckles27 (zone 1) enriched with the splicing factor SF3A66, the nucleolus28 (zones 8 and 9) enriched with fibrillarin, a key nucleolar protein. In addition, zone 2, enriched in active marks (RNAPII(Ser5P) and histone acetylation marks), formed contiguous regions in the nucleus that often surrounded the nuclear speckles27 (Fig. 3a, b). The three heterochromatin zones (zones 5, 6 and 7) had distinct combinatorial marks (Fig. 3a). In addition, several zones showed a mixture of marks, such as zone 3 and 4 with mixed repressive and active marks (Fig. 3a). These zones form physically distinct regions in single nuclei (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 8f\u2013h), rather than being well-mixed in the nucleus, suggesting that zones may form owing to phase separation or other mechanisms39.Fig. 3: Combinatorial chromatin patterns reveal nuclear zones.a, Heat map for differential enrichment of individual chromatin markers in each zone. b, Reconstructions of nuclear zones and DNA loci in a single z-plane.

Each dot represents a gene (22 genes, n\u00a0=\u00a0125 cells). j, Comparison between intron state and active zone (zones 1 and 2) association of the corresponding alleles (13 genes, n\u00a0=\u00a0125 cells). P values by two-sided Wilcoxon\u2019s signed rank-sum test; cells in the centre field of views were used (i, j).Full size imageWe assigned a zone for each DNA locus, or an interface if more than one zone was present (Methods). Some loci had characteristic zone associations, such as Pou5f1, which was associated with active zone 2 and zone 1\u20132 and zone 2\u20133 interfaces (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 8i, j, Supplementary Table 4). Many loci were enriched at interfaces between zones (Fig. 3b, c, Extended Data Fig. 8f, k, Supplementary Table 5), consistent with the observation of loci near the exterior of nuclear bodies and chromatin marks (Fig. 2e, g). For example, DNA loci are 46.3% more likely to be detected at zone 2\u20133 interfaces than random chance (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, pairs of interchromosomal loci were enriched at the active zone 2\u20133 interfaces, whereas pairs of intrachromosomal loci were enriched at the heterochromatic zone 5\u20137 interfaces and nucleolus zone 8\u20139 interfaces (Fig. 3c). Immunofluorescence images and zone assignments were limited by diffraction and background, and that even finer granularity would be observed with super-resolution imaging of the immunofluorescence markers (Methods).Active loci are pre-positionedSimultaneous imaging of nascent transcription active sites (TASs) by intronic FISH against 1,000 genes20, 14 immunofluorescence markers and DAPI in the same cells showed that TASs appear at the surface, rather than the centre, of RNAPII-dense regions in the nuclei (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 8h). They also appeared in the interfaces between active and mixed zones zone 2\u20133 twice as frequently compared with random chance, 16.8% vs 8.0% (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 8k, Supplementary Table 5). Average expression level across 1\u00a0Mb correlated with the association with active and nuclear speckle zones and interfaces (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 8l, m), consistent with previous findings37.However, in single cells, we observed little correlation between mRNA and intron expression and proximity with active and speckle zones among the genes we examined (27 genes for mRNA spanning a large range of expression levels and 14 genes for intron) (Fig. 3g\u2013j, Extended Data Fig. 8n, o). Given the typically shorter lifetime of introns and mRNAs (minutes to hours, respectively) compared with the possibly longer timescale of chromosomal positioning, it is likely that most genes are not dynamically positioned to the active zones (zones 1 and 2) for transcription. Rather, it is likely that most genes are pre-positioned to those zones or interfaces, and their positioning may be determined by underlying epigenetic states as well as other factors such as neighbouring gene density7.Global chromatin states are heterogeneousMouse ES cells have been shown to exist as metastable transcriptional states40,41,42 with subpopulations of differential gene expression profiles characterized both by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)42 and mRNA seqFISH (Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013c, Supplementary Table 6). We observed that the overall intensities of immunofluorescence signals in the nucleus also showed substantial heterogeneities among single cells (Fig. 4a). Clustering analysis of the immunofluorescence data (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9d, e) showed at least seven distinct states based on global chromatin modification levels, with most marker levels being independent from cell\u00a0cycle phases (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Notably, immunofluorescence states only partially overlapped with the transcriptional states. For example, \u2018ground\u2019 pluripotent-state cells expressing Zfp42, Nanog and Esrrb as well as Otx2-expressing orthogonal \u2018primed\u2019-state cells are present in most immunofluorescence clusters (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9e). In addition, global levels of H3K27me3 and mH2A1 were associated with naive or ground pluripotent states whereas H3K9me3 was associated with primed pluripotent states (Extended Data Fig. 9g\u2013j). These observations at the single-cell level extend the previous bulk studies43,44 showing increased total H3K27me3 levels and decreased H3K9me3 heterochromatin clusters in 2i-grown naive mouse ES cells compared with serum-grown mouse ES cells.Fig. 4: Global chromatin states are highly variable and dynamic in single cells.a, Intensities of immunofluorescence markers show heterogeneities in single cells.

(e, f). n\u00a0=\u00a0117 unlabelled cells within colonies in 48-h dataset. n\u00a0=\u00a053 cells in 24-h dataset.Full size imageChromatin states persist across generationsTo examine whether the heterogeneity in chromatin states, mRNA expression and chromosome organization are stable or dynamic across generations, we performed clonal analysis experiments. If clonally related cells have similar molecular states, then those states are likely to have slow dynamics, and vice versa (Fig. 4c). We seeded unlabelled mouse ES cells among GFP-positive mouse ES cells at a 1:10 ratio and cultured them for 24 or 48\u00a0h\u2014approximately 2 and 4 generations respectively\u2014such that each unlabelled mouse ES cell colony probably arises from a single cell (Fig. 4c, d, Extended Data Fig. 10a).Overall mRNA and chromatin profiles were highly correlated among most cells within a colony at the 24-h time point (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 10b), and maintained some correlation even at the 48-h time point. By contrast, chromosome proximities are preserved across one cell cycle between sisters but are then rapidly lost after two generations (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 10c\u2013e), consistent with previous studies with targeted chromosomes or regions45,46,47,48. Of note, the dynamics of individual immunofluorescence markers, such as mH2A1 and H3K27me3, were highly correlated within colonies but not between colonies, suggesting that these chromatin features are heritable across at least three to four generations (Fig. 4f). Conversely, many immunofluorescence marks, such as H3K9ac, did not correlate within a colony or between colonies, suggesting that these features are rapidly fluctuating.DiscussionOur spatial multimodal approach using DNA seqFISH+ along with multiplexed immunofluorescence and RNA seqFISH enables profiling of chromosome structures, nuclear bodies, chromatin states and gene expression within the same single cells. The precisely aligned images over multiple modalities enabled us to observe invariant features across nuclei despite the heterogeneity in chromosome structures in single cells. Notably, many DNA loci, especially active gene loci, reside at the surface of nuclear bodies and zone interfaces. Functionally, localization of target loci on surfaces might suggest that regulatory factors diffuse in 2D to search for their target genes. Finally, the observation of heterogeneous and long-lived global chromatin states raises the question of whether these states have distinct pluripotency and differentiation potentials and could represent hidden variables in differentiation experiments, which warrants further investigation. We anticipate that such spatial multiomics approaches will enable further exploration of those questions in many biological contexts.MethodsData reportingNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.DNA seqFISH+ encoding strategyA 16-base coding scheme with 5 rounds of barcoding is used in DNA seqFISH+ for the 1-Mb resolution data in fluorescent channel 1 (643\u00a0nm) and 2 (561\u00a0nm) (Extended Data Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 2). The first 3 rounds of barcoding codes for 163\u00a0=\u00a04,096 unique barcodes. Two additional rounds of parity check (linear combinations of the first three rounds) are included. A total of 2,048 barcodes were selected to correct for dropouts in any 2 out of 5 rounds of barcoding and used in both channel 1 and 2. The 16-pseudocolor base was generated by hybridizing the sample with 16 different readout oligonucleotides sequentially.To image 20 distinct regions (1.5\u20132.4 Mb in size) with 25-kb resolution, a combined strategy of diffraction limited spot imaging and chromosome painting is used in channel 3 (488\u00a0nm) (Extended Data Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 2), by extending previously demonstrated \u2018track first and identify later\u2019 approach19. For the initial 60 rounds, 25-kb regions are read out one at a time on all 20 chromosomes in each round of hybridization. These 60 rounds can resolve the 25-kb loci within each distinct region but cannot distinguish to\u00a0which chromosome the loci belong. The next 20 rounds are used to resolve the identities of the 20 distinct regions or chromosomes by painting the entire region (1.5\u20132.4 Mb) one at one time. With this strategy, identities for 1,200 loci are decoded.To implement these strategies, 80 unique readouts are used in each fluorescent channel for a total of 240 readouts for 3 channels.Primary probe designRNA seqFISH probes were designed as\u00a0previously described20,21. In brief, 35-nt RNA target binding sequences, 15-nt unique readout probe binding sites for each RNA target, and a pair of 20-nt primer binding sites at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the probe for probe generation (see \u2018Primary probe synthesis\u2019) are concatenated. Marker genes (Supplementary Table 6) were selected based on previous single-cell imaging and RNA-seq studies in mouse ES cells20,41,42,49.For DNA seqFISH+ target region selection (Supplementary Table 1), the unmasked and repeat-masked GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome FASTA files were downloaded from Ensembl release 9350. To select target regions for channel 1, the entire mouse genome was split into candidate target regions of 25 kb. Masking coverage was evaluated for each region using the repeat-masked genome. Regions with a high percentage of masked bases were removed from consideration. Then target regions were further selected to space out approximately 2 Mb in the genome coordinates. To select target regions for channel 2, candidate genes related to mouse ES cell pluripotency and differentiation were selected from previous studies35,42,51, and then 25-kb regions were selected by centering the transcription starting sites of the genes. To select target regions for channel 3, gene loci with various expression levels in mouse ES cells as well as gene-poor regions were initially selected as a 2.5-Mb block, and splitted into 25-kb blocks. Only a single 2.5-Mb region was selected per chromosome.Region-specific primary probes were designed as previously described for single-stranded RNA21 with some modifications. The target region was extracted from the unmasked genome. Probe sequences were produced by taking the reverse complement of 35-nt sections of the target region. Starting from the 5\u2032 end of the forward strand, candidate probes were tested for viability, shifting one base at a time. Probes that contained five or more consecutive bases of the same kind, or had a GC content outside of 45\u201365%, were considered non-viable. Each time a viable probe was discovered, evaluation was switched to the opposite strand, starting 19 nt downstream from the start of the viable probe to mitigate cross-hybridization between neighbouring probes. This procedure was repeated until the end of the target region was reached.Next, the probes were aligned to the unmasked mouse genome for off-target evaluation using Bowtie252. Any alignment containing at least 19 matched bases that fell outside the genomic coordinates of the target region was considered off-target. Probes with more than 10 total off-target hits were dropped. Off-target hits were grouped into 100-kb bins and stored for use in the final probe selection. Bins were overlapped by 50 kb so that closely grouped hits could not evade the filter by splitting into two bins. Additionally, probes were checked for matches with a BLAST53 database constructed from common repeating sequences in mammals. The FASTA file for \u2018Simple Repeat\u2019 sequences for \u2018Mammalia only\u2019 was downloaded from Repbase54. All probes with at least 19 matched bases with the repeats index were dropped. After filtering the probes, all remaining probes were evaluated for potential cross-hybridization using BLAST53. Any probe pairs with at least 19 matched bases were dropped in the final probe selection.Final probe sets were selected to maintain probe specificity, and to achieve a relatively uniform spacing of probes on the target sequence. Final probes were selected one by one, starting with the target region with the fewest remaining probes. The probe that minimized the sum of the squares of distances between adjacent selected probes and the start and end coordinates of the target region was selected. After selecting a probe, any probes that were found to cross-hybridize with at least 19\u00a0nt to the selected probe were dropped. As probes were added, their off-target hits were summed by bin. If the addition of a probe resulted in any bin having 10 total hits, all remaining unselected probes that had an off-target hit in that bin were dropped. For channel 1 and 2 probes, once 200 probes were selected for a target region, all remaining probes for that region were dropped. These two channels labelled 2,460 loci spaced approximately 1 Mb apart (1.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.78 Mb as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) across the whole genome. For the channel 3 probes, regions containing up to 150 probes were kept and other regions were dropped, and as a result, 1.5\u20132.4 Mb of 20 distinct regions containing 60 of 25-kb regions were finally selected as the 1,200 loci.Primary probes were then assembled similar to previous seqFISH studies18,19,20,21,55. At each locus targeted, we used up to 200 primary probes within the 25-kb genomic region as described above to image individual loci as diffraction limited spots based on DNA FISH56,57,58,59 and Oligopaint16 technologies. For Mb resolution DNA seqFISH+ in channel 1 and 2, primary probes consist of the genomic region specific 35-nt sequences, flanked by the five unique 15-nt readout probe binding sequences, which correspond to pseudo-channel in each barcoding round, and a pair of 20-nt primer binding sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the probe. For 25-kb resolution DNA seqFISH+ in channel 3, primary probes consist of the genomic region specific 35-nt sequences, flanked by three identical binding sites of a 15-nt readout probe, which corresponds to one of the 60 sequential rounds for the diffraction limited spot imaging, and two identical binding sites for a 15-nt readout probe, which corresponds to one of the 20 distinct regions for the chromosome painting, and 20-nt primer binding sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the probes.Primary probe synthesisPrimary probes were generated from oligoarray pools (Twist Bioscience) as previously described18,19,20,21,55 with some modifications. In brief, probe sequences were amplified from the oligonucleotide pools with limited two-step PCR cycles (first step PCR primers, 4-fwd: 5\u2032-ATGCGCTGCAACTGAGACCG; 4-rev: 5\u2032-CTCGACCAAGGCTGGCACAA; second step PCR primers, 4-fwd: 5\u2032-ATGCGCTGCAACTGAGACCG; 4-T7rev: 5\u2032-TAATACGACTCACTATAGCTCGACCAAGGCTGGCACAA), and PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen 28104). Then in vitro transcription (NEB E2040S) followed by reverse transcription (Thermo Fisher EP0751) were performed. For the DNA seqFISH+ primary probes, the forward primer (4-fwd) with 5\u2032 phosphorylation was used at the reverse transcription step to allow ligation of the primary probes as described below (see \u2018Cell culture experiment\u2019). After reverse transcription, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were alkaline hydrolysed with 1 M NaOH at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 15 min to degrade the RNA templates, and then neutralized with 1 M acetic acid. Then, probes were ethanol precipitated, and eluted in nuclease-free water.For the repetitive-element DNA FISH probes, LINE1 and SINEB1 probes were similarly generated except using mouse genomic DNA template extracted from E14 mouse ES cells with DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kits (Qiagen 69504) for PCR, followed by in vitro transcription and reverse transcription steps. Primers for LINE1 and SINEB133 contain readout probe binding sites as overhangs to allow readout probe hybridization and stripping with seqFISH routines. Genome targeting sequences of the primary probes were 113\u00a0nt and 117\u00a0nt for LINE1 and SINEB1, respectively. By contrast, the centromeric MinSat and telomere probes were generated as dye-conjugated 15-nt probes in the same way as readout probes (see \u2018Readout probe design and synthesis\u2019) using the following sequences (MinSat: 5\u2032-CACTGTTCTACAATG; telomere: 5\u2032-AACCCTAACCCTAAC), which directly target genomic DNA.Readout probe design and synthesisReadout probes of 12\u201315-nt in length were designed for seqFISH as previously described20,21. In brief, a set of probe sequences was randomly generated with combinations of A, T, G or C nucleotides with a GC-content range of 40\u201360%. To minimize cross-hybridization between the readout probes, any probes with ten or more contiguously matching sequences between the readout probes were removed. The readout probes for sequential immunofluorescence were similarly designed except the C nucleotide was omitted60. The 5\u2032 amine-modified DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) with the readout probe sequences were conjugated in-house to Alexa Fluor 647\u2013NHS ester (Invitrogen A20006) or Cy3B\u2013NHS ester (GE Healthcare PA63101) or Alexa Fluor 488\u2013NHS (Invitrogen A20000) as described before20,21, or fluorophore conjugated DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. In total, 240 unique readout probes21 were designed and synthesized for DNA seqFISH+ experiments, and subsets of those readout probes were used for RNA seqFISH experiments.DNA\u2013antibody conjugationPreparation of oligonucleotide DNA conjugated primary antibodies was performed as previously\u00a0described31 with modifications. In brief, to crosslink thiol-modified oligonucleotides to lysine residues on antibodies, BSA-free antibodies were purchased from commercial vendors whenever possible. Antibodies (90\u2013100 \u03bcg) were buffer-exchanged to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0PBS using 7K MWCO Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Scientific 89882), and reacted with 10 equivalents of PEGylated SMCC cross-linker (SM(PEG)2) (Thermo Scientific 22102) diluted in anhydrous DMF (Vector Laboratories S4001005). The solution was incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 3 h, and then purified using 7K MWCO Zeba Spin Desalting Columns. In parallel, 300 \u03bcM 5\u2032 thiol-modified 18-nt DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) were reduced by 50 mM dithiothreitol in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at room temperature for 2 h, and purified using NAP5 columns (GE Healthcare 17-0853-01). Then maleimide activated antibodies were mixed with 6\u201315 equivalents of the reduced form of the thiol-modified DNA oligonucleotides in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. DNA-primary antibody conjugates were washed with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS 4 times and concentrated using 50-KDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Millipore, UFC505096). The concentration of conjugated oligonucleotide DNA and antibody with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific 23225) were quantified using Nanodrop.For the BSA containing primary antibodies, SiteClick R-PE Antibody Labelling Kit (Life Technologies S10467) was used to conjugate the antibodies with 10\u201320 equivalent of 5\u2032 DBCO-modified 18-nt DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies). The oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies were validated by SDS\u2013PAGE gel and immunofluorescence, and stored in 1\u00d7 PBS at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C as small aliquots.Cell culture and preparationE14 mouse ES cells (E14Tg2a.4) from Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers were maintained under serum/LIF condition as previously described20,41. A stable E14 line that targets endogenous repetitive regions with the CRISPR\u2013Cas system61 was generated similarly to the previous study19. In brief, PiggyBac vectors, PGK-NLS-dCas9-NLS-3xEGFP, carrying a separate puromycin resistance cassette under an EF1 promoter, and mU6-sg3632454L22Rik(F+E), carrying a separate neomycin resistance cassette under a SV40 promoter, were constructed. A single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence (5\u2032-GGAAGCCAGCTGT) was used to target repetitive regions at the 3632454L22Rik gene locus in X chromosome. To create the stable E14 line (GFP/Neo E14) with those vectors, transfection was performed with FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega E2311), and cells were selected with puromycin (Gibco A1113803) at 1 \u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121. After the selection, single clones were isolated manually, and stable labelling of the locus was verified by imaging. The cell lines were authenticated by DNA seqFISH+ (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013g), multiplexed immunofluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013f), and RNA seqFISH (Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013c), all of which gave results consistent with the ES cell identity. The cells were not tested for mycoplasma contamination.E14 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma P6407) and human laminin (BioLamina LN511) coated coverslips (25 mm \u00d7 60 mm)20, and incubated for 24 or 48 h. Then cells were fixed with freshly made 4% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific 28908) in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS (Invitrogen AM9624) at room temperature for 10 min. The fixed cells were washed with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS a few times, and stored in 70% ethanol at \u201320\u2009\u00b0C12. In the case of co-culture experiments with unlabelled E14 cells and the GFP/Neo E14 cells (monoclonal line), cell densities were counted and cell lines were mixed with a 1:10 ratio.Cell culture experimentThe fixed and stored cell samples were dried, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich 93443) in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at room temperature for 15 min after attaching a sterilized silicon plate (McMASTER-CARR 86915K16) with a punched hole to the coverslip to use it as a chamber. The samples were washed three times with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS and blocked at room temperature for 15 min with blocking solution consisted of 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS, 10 mg\u00a0ml\u22121 UltraPure BSA (Invitrogen AM2616), 0.3% Triton-X, 0.1% dextran sulfate (Sigma D4911) and 0.5 mg\u00a0ml\u22121 sheared Salmon Sperm DNA (Invitrogen AM9680). Then DNA oligonucleotide-conjugated primary antibodies listed below were incubated in the blocking solution with 100-fold diluted SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen AM2694) at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The typical final concentration of DNA conjugated primary antibodies used were estimated as 1\u20135 ng\u00a0\u03bcl\u22121. The samples were washed with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS three times and incubated at room temperature for 15 min, before post-fixing with freshly made 4% formaldehyde in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Next, the samples were washed with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS six times and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were then further post-fixed with 1.5 mM BS(PEG)5 (PEGylated bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) (Thermo Scientific A35396) in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at room temperature for 20 min, followed by quenching with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4 (Alfa Aesar J62848) at room temperature for 5 min. After the post-fixation, the samples were washed with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS and air dried after removing the custom silicon chamber.The oligonucleotide DNA-conjugated primary antibodies used were as follows: mH2A1 (Abcam ab232602), E-cadherin (R&D AF748), fibrillarin (C13C3) (Cell Signaling 2639BF), geminin (Abcam ab238988), GFP (Invitrogen G10362), H3 (Active Motif 39763), H3K27ac (Active Motif 39133), H3K27me2 (Cell Signaling 9728BF), H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling 9733BF), H3K4me1 (Cell Signaling 5326S), H3K4me2 (Cell Signaling 9725BF), H3K4me3 (Active Motif 39915), H3K9ac (Active Motif 91103), H3K9me2 (Abcam ab1220), H3K9me3 (Diagenode MAb-146-050), H3pSer10 (Millipore 05-806), H4K16ac (EMD Millipore 07-329), H4K20me1 (Abcam ab9051), H4K20me2 (Abcam ab9052), H4K20me3 (Active Motif 39671), lamin B1 (Abcam ab220797), RNAPII(Ser5P) (Abcam ab5408), SF3A66 (Abcam ab77800). Two antibodies (E-cadherin and GFP) were only included in the clonal tracing experiments. Several antibodies (H3, H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) were excluded from the downstream analysis\u00a0owing to the quality of antibody staining with oligonucleotide conjugation.After the immunofluorescence preparation above, custom-made flow cells (fluidic volume about\u00a030 \u03bcl), which were made from glass slide (25 \u00d7 75 mm) with 1-mm thickness and 1-mm diameter holes and a PET film coated on both sides with an acrylic adhesive with total thickness 0.25 mm (Grace Bio-Labs RD481902), were attached to the coverslips. The samples were rinsed with 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC, and RNA seqFISH primary probe pools (1\u201310 nM per probe) and 10 nM polyT LNA oligonucleotide with a readout probe binding DNA sequence (Qiagen) were hybridized in 50% hybridization buffer consisted of 50% formamide (Invitrogen AM9342), 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (Millipore 3710-OP). The hybridization was performed at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u201372 h in a humid chamber. After hybridization, the samples were washed with a 55% wash buffer consisting of 55% formamide, 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min, followed by three rinses with 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC. Then samples were imaged for RNA seqFISH as described below (see \u2018seqFISH imaging\u2019). Note that immunofluorescence signals were imaged at this step for validation in Extended Data Fig. 2f, g.After RNA seqFISH imaging, the samples were processed for DNA seqFISH+ primary probe hybridization. The samples were rinsed with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS, and incubated with 100-fold diluted RNase A/T1 Mix (Thermo Fisher EN0551) in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1 h. Then samples were rinsed three times with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS, followed by three rinses with a 50% denaturation buffer consisting of 50% formamide and 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Then the samples were heated on the heat block at 90\u2009\u00b0C for 4.5 min in the 50% denaturation buffer, by sealing the inlet and outlet of the custom chamber with aluminium sealing tapes (Thermo Scientific 232698). After heating, the samples were rinsed with 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC, and DNA seqFISH+ primary hybridization buffer consisting of about\u00a01 nM per probe, about\u00a01 \u03bcM LINE1 probe,\u00a0about 1 \u03bcM SINEB1 probe, 100 nM 3632454L22Rik fiducial marker probe (Integrated DNA Technologies), 40% formamide, 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (Millipore 3710-OP) was hybridized at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 48\u201396 h in a humid chamber. After hybridization, the samples were washed with a 40% wash buffer consisting of 40% formamide, 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min, followed by three rinses with 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC.Then samples were further processed to \u2018padlock\u201962,63 primary probes to prevent the loss of signals during 80 rounds of DNA seqFISH+ imaging routines (see \u2018seqFISH imaging\u2019). A global ligation bridge oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies) was hybridized in a 20% hybridization buffer consisting of 20% formamide, dextran sulfate (Sigma D4911) and 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2 h. The 31-nt global ligation bridge (5\u2032-TCAGTTGCAGCGCATGCTCGACCAAGGCTGG) was designed to hybridize to 15 nt of the DNA seqFISH+ primary probes at 5\u2032 end and 16 nt at the 3\u2032 end. Then, samples were washed with 10% WB (10% formamide, 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 0.1% Triton X-100) three times and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After three rinses with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS, the samples were then incubated with 20-fold diluted Quick Ligase in 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Quick Ligase Reaction Buffer from Quick Ligation Kit (NEB M2200) supplemented with additional 1 mM ATP (NEB P0756) at room temperature for 1 h to allow ligation reaction between 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends of the DNA seqFISH+ primary probes. Unlike the conventional padlock primary probe design62,63, our primary probe ligation sites were on the 31-nt global ligation bridge at the primer binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b), and not on the genomic DNA. Then the samples were washed with a 12.5% wash buffer consisting of 12.5% formamide, 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by three rinses with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS.The samples were then processed for amine modification and post-fixation to further stabilize the primary probes. The samples were rinsed with 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0labelling buffer A, followed by incubation with tenfold diluted Label IT amine modifying reagent in 1\u00d7\u00a0labelling buffer A from Label IT nucleic acid modifying reagent (Mirus Bio MIR 3900) at room temperature for 45 min. After three rinses with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS, the samples were fixed with 1.5 mM BS(PEG)5 in 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS at room temperature for 30 min, followed by quenching with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4 at room temperature for 5 min. The samples were washed with a 55% wash buffer at room temperature for 5 min, and rinsed with 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC three times. Then samples were imaged for DNA seqFISH+ and sequential immunofluorescence as described below (see \u2018seqFISH imaging\u2019).The 1,000-gene intron experiments in Fig. 3c\u2013e and Extended Data Fig. 8h, k were performed similarly with minor modifications. E14 coverslips were prepared and processed by following the sequential immunofluorescence steps above. After the sequential immunofluorescence preparation, 1,000-gene intron FISH probes20 were hybridized in the 50% hybridization buffer at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24 h in a humid chamber. Then samples were washed with the 55% wash buffer at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by three rinses with 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC. Then samples were imaged for intron FISH and sequential immunofluorescence as described below (see \u2018seqFISH imaging\u2019).The telomere validation experiments in Extended Data Fig. 2a, b were performed similarly with minor modifications. Samples were prepared as described above and hybridized with a telomere primary probe, consisting of 20-nt telomere targeting sequence, five 15-nt readout probe binding sites and 20-nt primer binding sites with 5\u2032 phosphorylation, in the 20% hybridization buffer at 37\u2009\u00b0C overnight in a humidity chamber. Then samples were prepared with or without ligation and post-fixation steps as described above. After samples were imaged with the imaging procedure (see \u2018seqFISH imaging\u2019), samples were incubated in the 55% WB at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 16 h. Then the original positions were imaged again under the same imaging procedure (see \u2018seqFISH imaging\u2019) to evaluate the padlocking efficiency across different conditions.Microscope setupAll imaging experiments were performed with the imaging platform and fluidics delivery system similar to those previously described20,21. The microscope (Leica DMi8) was equipped with a confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa CSU-W1), a sCMOS camera (Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus), 63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0oil objective lens (Leica 1.40 NA), and a motorized stage (ASI MS2000). Fibre-coupled lasers (643, 561, 488 and 405 nm) from CNI and Shanghai Dream Lasers Technology and filter sets from Semrock were used. The custom-made automated sampler was used to move designated readout probes in hybridization buffer from a 2.0-ml 96-well plate through a multichannel fluidic valve (IDEX Health & Science EZ1213-820-4) to the custom-made flow cell using a syringe pump (Hamilton Company 63133-01). Other buffers were also moved through the multichannel fluidic valve to the custom-made flow cell using the syringe pump. The integration of imaging and the automated fluidics delivery system was controlled by custom-written scripts in \u03bcManager64.seqFISH imagingThe sequential hybridization and imaging routines were performed similarly to those previously described20,21 with some modifications. In brief, the sample with the custom-made flow cell was first connected to the automated fluidics system on the motorized stage on the microscope. Then the regions of interest (ROIs) were registered using nuclei signals stained with 5 \u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 DAPI (Sigma D8417) in 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC. RNA seqFISH imaging was performed with the sequential hybridization and imaging routines described below first. After the completion of RNA seqFISH imaging, the samples were disconnected from the microscope, and proceeded to the DNA seqFISH+ procedures (see \u2018Cell culture experiment\u2019). For the DNA seqFISH+ and sequential immunofluorescence imaging, the registered ROIs for RNA seqFISH were loaded and manually corrected to ensure to image the same ROIs as RNA seqFISH imaging, and following routines were performed.All the sequential hybridization and imaging routines below were performed at room temperature. The serial hybridization buffer contained two or three unique readout probes (10\u201350 nM) with different fluorophores (Alexa Fluor 647, Cy3B or Alexa Fluor 488) in 10% EC buffer (10% ethylene carbonate (Sigma E26258), 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma D4911) and 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC), and was picked up from a 96-well plate and flow into the flow cell for 20 min incubation. For DNA seqFISH+ experiments, readout probes (Alexa Fluor 647, Cy3B or Alexa Fluor 488) for sequences designated as fiducial markers were also included in the serial hybridization buffer to allow image registration at the subpixel resolution. After the serial hybridization, the samples were washed with 1 ml of 4\u00d7\u00a0SSCT (4\u00d7\u00a0SSC and 0.1% Triton-X), followed by a wash with 330 \u03bcl of the 12.5% wash buffer. Then, the samples were rinsed with about\u00a0200 \u03bcl of 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC, and stained with about\u00a0200 \u03bcl of the DAPI solution for 30 s. Next, anti-bleaching buffer was flown through the sample for imaging. The anti-bleaching buffer was made of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (Invitrogen 15568025), 300 mM NaCl (Invitrogen AM9759), 2\u00d7\u00a0SSC, 3 mM trolox (Sigma 238813), 0.8% d-glucose (Sigma G7528), 1,000-fold diluted catalase (Sigma C3155), 0.5 mg\u00a0ml\u22121 glucose oxidase (Sigma G2133)20 for E14 experiments, and made of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC, 3 mM trolox, 10% d-glucose, 100-fold diluted catalase, 1 mg\u00a0ml\u22121 glucose oxidase (Sigma G2133)21 for unlabelled E14 and GFP/Neo E14 line clonal experiments.Snapshots were acquired with 0.25-\u03bcm z-steps over 6-\u03bcm z-slices with 643-nm, 561-nm, 488-nm and 405-nm fluorescent channels per field of view, except for RNA seqFISH in the clonal experiments, which were acquired with 0.75-\u03bcm z-steps with 643-nm, 561-nm and 488-nm fluorescent channels. After image acquisition, 1 ml of the 55% wash buffer was flown for 1 min to strip off readout probes, followed by an incubation for 1 min before rinsing with 4\u00d7\u00a0SSC. The serial hybridization, imaging and signal extinguishing steps were repeated until the completion of all rounds. During the RNA seqFISH and DNA seqFISH+ imaging routines, blank images containing only autofluorescence of the cells were imaged at the beginning and end of the routines. During the DNA seqFISH+ imaging, images containing only fiducial markers were also imaged at the beginning and at the end of the routines for the image alignment (see \u2018Image analysis\u2019). Images were manually checked at the end of all imaging routines and in case problematic hybridization rounds such as off-focus appeared, those hybridization rounds were repeated.Each readout probe hybridization and stripping routine took approximately 30 min. Imaging time per position took around 2.5\u20136 min at each hybridization round with our microscope setup and imaging conditions described above, and we typically imaged for 30 min per hybridization round with 5\u201310 positions. In total, it took approximately 80 h to complete the 80 rounds of the hybridization and imaging routine for the DNA seqFISH+ experiments.Image analysisTo correct for the non-uniform background, a flat field correction was applied by dividing the normalized background illumination with each of the fluorescence images while preserving the intensity profile of the fluorescent points. The background signal was then subtracted using the ImageJ rolling ball background subtraction algorithm with a radius of 3 pixels.FISH spot locations were obtained by using a Laplacian of Gaussians filter, semi-manual thresholding as described below, and a 3D local maxima finder. Subsequently the locations were super resolved using a 3D radial centre algorithm65,66. In brief, a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 cube of pixels around a local maxima found above the specified threshold was taken from the aligned and background subtracted image. This sub-image was then used to calculate the sub-pixel location of the RNA molecule or DNA locus and the mean standard deviation (average of the standard deviation in each dimension) of the intensity cloud using a 3D radial centre algorithm. A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm can be found on the Parthasarathy lab website (https://pages.uoregon.edu/raghu/particle_tracking.html). The resulting RNA or DNA spot locations were further filtered on the basis of the size of the sigma values.To find the optimal threshold values for the spot detection, threshold values for RNA seqFISH were updated manually. By contrast, for DNA seqFISH+, 29 incremental threshold values, were initially applied to the images in the first position. The number of spots and median spot intensity in the nuclei were computed for each of the 29 thresholds across 80 hybridizations. Then the threshold value for the first hybridization round was manually chosen, and threshold for the other hybridizations were selected such that the number of dots detected matches most closely to those expected from the codebook. For example, if hyb1 targets 30 loci and hyb2 targets 60 loci, then hyb2 should have twice as many dots as hyb1. In this process, we assumed all loci can be detected with the same detection efficiency on average. In addition, the median intensities from the adjacent threshold values were compared, and whenever intensity differences were more than 15%, a more stringent threshold value was taken to fulfill this criteria to minimize non-specific spot detection. These processes were performed in individual fluorescent channels independently. Similarly, we corrected the threshold values across positions by computing the ratio of the median intensities relative to those from the first position per hybridization in order to minimize detection bias across different positions.To align spots or images in different channels to those in the reference channel (643 nm), chromatic aberration shifts were corrected using the fiducial markers to calculate the offsets. To align RNA seqFISH and sequential immunofluorescence images in different hybridization rounds, reference channels (either DAPI or polyA staining) were aligned using 2D phase correlations along every axis iteratively to find a consensus transformation for alignment as\u00a0previously described20. The 2D phase correlation algorithm is implemented in MATLAB with the function imregcorr. To align DNA seqFISH+ spots in different hybridization rounds, fiducial markers were identified in each image by searching for the known \u2018constellation\u2019 seen in images containing only the fiducial markers. To identify a first pair of distant fiducial markers, the vector describing the relative position of the known markers was compared with those separating similarly oriented pairs of FISH spots in each image. Most, if not all, of the fiducial marker \u2018constellation\u2019 can then be recovered by searching for each fiducial marker at its known location relative to that of previously identified fiducial markers in the image. Further alignment to correct any rotation between RNA and DNA FISH images was done as follows. First, both image stacks to be aligned (DAPI or immunostaining) were converted to 2D images using a maximum intensity projection in the z-dimension. The resulting 2D images were aligned using a one plus one evolutionary optimization method to maximize the Mattes mutual information between the images with the transformation constrained to only rigid transforms with a maximum of 500 iterations. This algorithm is implemented in MATLAB with the function imregtform. Once 2D alignment with both translation and rotation was obtained, one stack was transformed using the found transformation. The image stacks were then projected along the x axis and aligned using a normalized cross-correlation to determine the first estimate of the z-dimension offset. The image was then projected along the y axis to find a second estimate of the z-dimension offset using the same method. The two offsets were averaged.To assign mRNA spots to individual cells, the processed spots were collected within individual cytoplasmic ROIs, which were segmented manually from polyA or E-cadherin images. Similarly, to assign intron and DNA spots to individual cells, the spots within individual nuclear ROIs from DAPI images20 were collected. By comparing the centroids between cytoplasmic ROIs and nuclear ROIs, numbers from both ROIs were matched. Only cells at the centre of the fields of view were preserved for the RNA analysis to avoid biasing the RNA distribution.For channel 1 and 2 barcode decoding in DNA seqFISH+, once all potential points in all hybridizations were obtained, points were matched to potential barcode partners in all other barcoding rounds of all other hybridizations using a 1.73 (square root of 3) pixel search radius to find symmetric nearest neighbours in 3D. This process was performed in each nuclear ROIs. Point combinations that constructed only a single barcode were immediately matched to the on-target barcode set. Two rounds of error correction were implemented out of five total barcoding rounds. For points that matched to multiple barcodes, the point sets were filtered by calculating the residual spatial distance of each potential barcode point set and only the point sets giving the minimum residuals were used to match to a barcode. If multiple barcodes were still possible, the point was matched to its closest on-target barcode with a hamming distance of 1. If multiple on target barcodes were still possible, then the point was dropped from the analysis as an ambiguous barcode. This procedure was repeated using each barcoding round as a seed for barcode finding and only barcodes that were called similarly in at least 4 out of 5 seeds were used in the analysis. This criteria on average dropped 19.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8% (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) of identified barcode spots compared to the less stringent criteria using at least 3 out of 5 seeds, while minimizing the detection of false positive barcode dots. The false negatives can be caused by this dropout of barcode dots as well as by incomplete denaturation of chromosomal DNA or hybridization of primary probes. For the false positive estimates, both blank barcodes and on-target barcodes were run simultaneously. Those blank barcodes consisted of all the remaining barcodes out of 2,048 barcodes that allow 2 rounds of error correction in 5 total barcoding rounds.For channel 3 decoding in DNA seqFISH+, once all potential points in the first 60 hybridizations (hyb1\u201360) were obtained, intensities of all the potential chromosome paint partners in the other 20 hybridizations (hyb61\u201380) were computed on the rounded pixels where points were found. At this step, each point has 20 intensity values, corresponding to those from individual chromosome paints. Those chromosome paint intensities found on the points in nuclei from all positions and all hybridization rounds (hyb1\u201360) were grouped by chromosome, and then z score was calculated. The z-score values were thresholded with 1, and each point was assigned with unique chromosome identity, whose value was above the threshold. Only a minimum fraction of points (<3%) were assigned to multiple chromosomes and dropped as ambiguous points. In addition, points without any chromosome assignment were dropped as ambiguous points.Exterior and interior voxels of immunofluorescence markersFor the sequential immunofluorescence image processing, in contrast to spot detection processing as described above, background subtraction was not applied to the images, except for marker edge detection described below and RNAP II Ser5-P visualization shown in Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 8h. The alignment and correction for chromatic aberration shifts between different fluorescent channels were performed as described above. Then intensity values for all the voxels within individual nuclear ROIs were obtained for all immunofluorescence channels as well as repetitive elements (telomere, MinSat, LINE1 and SINEB1) and DAPI. The edge detection for chromatin marker exterior quantification was performed using the Find edges function in ImageJ with background subtracted images (rolling ball radius 3 pixels), and then the intensity values were obtained in the same way as the aligned images above.After image processing steps above, pixel information was converted to physical distance based on the microscope setup and imaging condition with 103 nm for x and y pixels and 250 nm for z pixels for the subsequent downstream analysis.Analysis of sequencing-based dataHi-C data from NCBI GEO (accession GSE96107) was processed using Juicer tools67 and contact maps containing Knight\u2013Ruiz normalized counts68 were obtained. SPRITE data were obtained from the 4D Nucleome data portal (https://data.4dnucleome.org/, accession 4DNESOJRTZZR). ChIP\u2013seq data for H3K27me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac were obtained from ENCODE (https://www.encodeproject.org/, accession ENCSR000CFN, ENCSR000CGP and ENCSR000CGQ) as bigWig tracks and the average relative signal in each genomic bin was calculated using the UCSC Genome Browser program bigWigAverageOverBed. DamID data were obtained from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession GSE17051) and the genomic coordinates of DamID microarray probes were converted from mm9 to mm10 using the UCSC Genome Browser program liftover. DamID values were calculated as the mean DamID score within each genomic bin. Repli-seq data were obtained from NCBI GEO (accession GSE102076) and the replication timing at each genomic bin was calculated as the log2-transformed\u00a0ratio of early and late S fractions. GRO-seq data were obtained from NCBI GEO (GSE48895) and aligned to mm10 using Bowtie252 to create .bam files. Read counts at each genomic bin were obtained from .bam files using bedtools multicov. Hi-C data were binned at 25-, 50-, 100-, 250-, 500-kb and 1-Mb resolution, and all the other data were binned at 1-Mb resolution. For Hi-C analysis, overlapping regions within a given bin size were excluded from the analysis (Fig. 1f with 100-kb bin resolution, Fig. 1g with 25-kb bin resolution, and Extended Data Fig. 3 with described bin resolution).Visualization of seqFISH dataDNA seqFISH+ data were visualized using PyMOL (Molecular Graphics System, v.2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger) by generating a .xyz file containing the x, y and z coordinates of each FISH probe coordinate. Each coordinate was displayed as a sphere, and sticks were drawn between coordinates that were consecutive in the genome. Immunofluorescence and repetitive element DNA FISH signals were visualized by displaying a surface around x, y and z coordinates with intensity Z-score values above 2.Estimation for DNA seqFISH+ detection efficiencyWe estimated the detection efficiency of DNA seqFISH+ considering the cell cycle distribution as previously\u00a0described19. In brief, typical cell cycle phases distribute as 20% in G1, 50% in S and 30% in G2/M phase in mouse ES cells. Given the number of DNA loci is 2 in G1, 3 in S and 4 in G2/M phase, the average number of spots expected for each locus is 3.1 in a single cell, which can be half for chromosome X (n\u00a0=\u00a0180 loci in DNA seqFISH+) in male diploid E14 cells. In our DNA seqFISH+ experiments, we observed 5,616.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01,551.4 (median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) for 3,660 loci in single cells, and the detection efficiency can be estimated as 50.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.0% (median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.).DNA proximity map analysisTo generate a pairwise proximity map from the DNA seqFISH+ dataset, for each locus in a single cell, the identities of other loci within a search radius of 500 nm for channel 1 and 2 and 150 nm for channel 3 were tabulated. The total occurrence of any pairwise interaction was normalized by the product of the occurrence frequency of each of the loci. The proximity map was compared with the Hi-C map23 in Fig. 1g. The proximity maps for all chromosomes for both 1-Mb and 25-kb data are shown in Extended Data Figs. 3, 4.Physical distance versus genomic distanceIn each cell, two homologous chromosomes were separated by finding the consensus between two clustering algorithms: Spectral method in the FindClusters function in Mathematica and Ward method. For most chromosomes in single cells, the two copies of homologous chromosomes occupied distinct regions in the nucleus, whereas in some cells, they were fused together. In a small percentage of cells, three or more alleles of the same chromosome could be observed. However, in a vast majority of cells, only two chromosomal territories were observed, indicating that replicated chromosomes mostly stay together69 until segregation. For the 25-kb data, the alleles were separated by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in scikit-learn library in Python.Along each allele of a given chromosome in single cells, we calculated the physical distances between all pairs of detected loci and paired them with their genomic distances. For a fixed genomic distance, the median physical separation values are shown in Fig. 1h for the 1-Mb data for all the chromosomes, and Fig. 1i for the 25-kb resolution data.Immunofluorescence normalization and clustering analysisFor the voxel-based multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis, we first aligned the sequential immunofluorescence data across all rounds of hybridization (see \u2018Image analysis\u2019). Then voxels in each channel were binned 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 (200 nm \u00d7 200 nm \u00d7 250 nm), because the diffraction limit is approximately 200\u2013250 nm in the fluorescence channels imaged. All subsequent data analyses were performed on the binned data. Because tens of millions of voxels from all of the cells were too numerous for clustering analysis, representative subsets of voxels were selected, clustered and used as a training set to train a model which then propagated the cluster identification to all voxels in the data. To do so, voxels from a single Z-plane (plane 13, approximately at the midpoint in the cell) out of 25 z-slices for all cells were selected. In each cell, individual channels were z-score normalized. The voxels with total z-score values more than 0 summed over 16 immunofluorescence channels were selected and normalized by the total z-score to account for voxel-to-voxel intensity variations. All pixels of the cells within the first experiment (n\u00a0=\u00a0201 cells) were then combined and one out of every 200 pixels are selected and clustered by hierarchical clustering using the Mathematica Agglomerate function and Ward distance option. 10 clusters or nuclear zones were assigned to all 60,482 pixels as the training set. These classified zone definitions were then propagated to the rest of the pixels in each cell normalized by the above procedure using the GradientBoostedTree option in the Classify function in Mathematica. Separately, pixels with lamin B1 and fibrillarin marker z-score >1 were assigned to the nuclear lamina and nucleolus zones. The 44,000 pixels, which are assigned to one of the 12 nuclear zones and contain 16 intensity values from individual immunofluorescence markers, were then visualized in Extended Data Fig. 8b with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)70 using a UMAP-learn library in Python.To compare the immunofluorescence zone assignments with and without DNA FISH, we used the immunofluorescence data from the intron experiments. We used the same training set from the DNA seqFISH+ dataset and propagated the classifiers to the immunofluorescence data in the intron experiment. We found similar composition of zones in the intron experiments, indicating that immunofluorescence data are not affected significantly with the denaturing conditions in DNA FISH. Results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8d.Similarly, we downsampled the number of immunofluorescence marks used to assign the zones. We reduced the number of immunofluorescence marks systematically and used 80% of the pixels as the new training set to determine what fraction of the pixels are assigned correctly. Results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8e. Twenty random subsets of immunofluorescence marks are drawn for each downsample immunofluorescence number. Band shows the standard deviation of the correct zone assignment.The zone assignments are based on the combinatorial chromatin marks at each diffraction-limited pixel. Thus, the resolution and the boundary of the zones are also diffraction limited, which could contribute to some of the mixed zones detected. For example, we cautiously note that previous super-resolution imaging71 showed that lamin B1 meshwork is around 100-nm thick at the nuclear periphery, while our zone analysis showed lamin B1 enriched zone 11 and mixed zone 12 were typically found at the pixels further than 100 nm from the nuclear periphery (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 8f\u2013h), possibly owing to the limitation of the resolution. In addition, background signals of the multiplexed immunofluorescence could also affect the nuclear zone distribution patterns. Future works with super-resolution microscopy may resolve the mixed regions at finer resolution.DNA loci to immunofluorescence marker interactionsWe calculated the spatial distances between each DNA locus and the nearest \u2018hot\u2019 immunofluorescence voxel, defined as 2\u00a0s.d. above the mean value for each immunofluorescence marker. We also calculated the distance of each DNA loci to the exterior of immunofluorescence nuclear bodies, also 2\u00a0s.d. above the mean for the edge processed image described under \u2018Image analysis\u2019 (Extended Data Fig. 5b) for each immunofluorescence marker. Both metrics, defined as interior and exterior distances, are highly correlated (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). From this distance metric, we generated a chromatin profile by counting the percentage of cells in which each DNA loci is within 300 nm of the surface of an immunofluorescence mark, the resolution of the diffraction-limited immunofluorescence images. These chromatin profiles were correlated with ChIP\u2013seq24, DamID35, and SPRITE7 datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b).For lamin B1, we calculated the distances from DNA loci to lamin B1 signals with two and three s.d. away from the mean intensity, as well as using only lamin B1 signals at the nuclear periphery (as determined from the convex hull of the nuclear pixels) and the nuclear periphery pixels. Similar lamin B1 or nuclear periphery association profiles were observed for all analysis in correlation plots (Extended Data Fig. 6c) across DNA loci (Extended Data Fig. 6e).Fixed loci were determined as loci that appear 2\u00a0s.d. above the mean percentage score for each immunofluorescence mark. The distance between fixed loci and the exterior and interior of nuclear bodies, pixels 2\u00a0s.d. above the mean in the edge processed and raw images for each immunofluorescence mark, are shown in Fig. 2e. The average expression level for fixed loci associated with different immunofluorescence marks are calculated from bulk RNA-seq and shown in Extended Data Fig. 8m.Chromosome configuration (Supplementary Table 3) of the fixed points calculates the fraction of cells (n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells) for each chromosome that contains at least one fixed locus from a given pair of the immunofluorescence markers. This metric measures how likely fixed points from different immunofluorescence markers are to span nuclear bodies in single cells.Previous literature reported the approximate locations of rDNA on a subset of chromosomes with non-sequencing methods. In mouse, rDNA arrays are encoded on the centromere-proximal regions of chromosomes 12, 15, 16, 18 and 19, and the patterns of distribution differ in a mouse strain-specific manner72,73,74. We found all fixed loci for the nucleolar marker fibrillarin in those chromosomes (n\u00a0=\u00a039, 1, 22, 30 and 41 loci for chromosome 12, 15, 16, 18 and 19), with less enrichment on chromosome 15 (Fig. 2d, h). Previous studies using the allele of the 129 mouse strain reported the loss of rDNA or nucleolar enrichments on chromosome 157,73,74, consistent with our observation with E14 cells derived from the 129/Ola mouse strain.The chromatin profiles for all loci were clustered by hierarchical clustering using the Agglomerate function in Mathematica with the Ward distance option and plotted as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots (Extended Data Fig. 7a) with the scikit-learn library in Python. Fifteen chromatin marks and DAPI were used, and 4 clusters were selected. Cluster 1 was enriched in repressive markers such as H3K9me3, mH2A1 and DAPI. Cluster 2 was enriched in interactions with fibrillarin and associated with nucleolus. Cluster 3 was enriched in active marks such as RNAPII(Ser5P), H3k27ac and SF3A66 (speckle marker). Cluster 4 was enriched in lamin B1. In individual cells, loci associated with each cluster were mapped onto the chromosome structure images shown in Extended Data Fig. 7b. To calculate the spatial proximity spatial proximity of loci within and between clusters, we computed the frequency of finding a locus from a given cluster within a 1 \u03bcm radius with another locus of the same or different cluster identity. The total number of intra-cluster and inter-cluster interactions were tabulated and normalized to unity. Randomized data was generated by scrambling the cluster identities of individual loci in cells while keeping the total number of loci within each cluster the same within that cell. The proximity frequency for observed and randomized data for each cell are shown as box plots in Extended Data Fig. 7d and for different search radii in Extended Data Fig. 7e. Similar analysis is performed for A/B compartment assignments23, and shown in Extended Data Fig. 7f\u2013j. The loci without A/B compartment assignments in the study were excluded from the analysis.Association of loci with zonesFor each DNA locus decoded from the DNA seqFISH+ experiment, the nearest pixels within 300 nm and the zone assignments for those pixels were collected in each cell. It is possible to have a locus be in association with multiple zones. If a locus interacts with more than two zones\u2014for example, Pou5f1 in cell 38 interacts with zone 1, 2 and 8\u2014then its zone interactions were divided into pairs of zones, or interfaces. In other words, that locus was counted 1/3 towards each of the interfaces (1, 2), (2, 8) and (1, 8). For individual loci, the frequencies of appearing in all zones and interfaces were normalized to unity and shown in Extended Data Fig. 8i, j. For the analysis shown in Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8k, the total number of DNA loci detected each zone and interfaces were tabulated and normalized to unity for each zone or interfaces between pairs of zones. The same analysis for zone proximity was performed on the set of loci that are interacting with other loci on the same chromosomes (intra-chromosomal) and with loci on the other chromosomes (inter-chromosomal) within 300 nm. Similarly, the introns from the 1,000-gene experiments were tabulated for their zone and interface assignments. Randomized DNA loci were generated by selecting a random set of voxels in the nucleus while keeping the total number of DNA loci the same in a given cell. Then the voxels were offset by a random xyz value with a 100-nm radius. To bootstrap all of the datasets, we randomly sampled 150 cells out of n\u00a0=\u00a0201 cells with 20 trials and calculated the mean and s.e.m.Correlation of zone with gene expressionTo calculate the correlation between expression and zone assignment, we took each channel 1 and 2 locus and computed the total RNA-seq FPKM values49 within 50 kb upstream and downstream of that locus. We normalized the total frequency of appearing in one of the zones or interfaces to unity for each loci. We then correlated the log(1\u00a0+\u00a0expression value) of all 2,460 regions with the frequency of finding them in each of the zones or interfaces. Similar analysis was performed for GRO-seq75 using log(1\u00a0+\u00a0GRO-seq value) and replication timing76 datasets with mouse ES cells.To determine whether we can predict the mean expression values for each locus based on its zone association profiles, we estimated the expression level for a given locus as a sum of the product between the normalized frequency of being in each zone or interface for that locus and the PCC between the zone or interface with the mean expression value across all the loci. The estimated expression values for all 2,460 loci were correlated with the actual expression values with a PCC of 0.54.For calculating the correlation between mRNA expression levels with zone assignments in single cells, we first z-scored the single cell mRNA seqFISH measurements for 22 genes after normalizing by Eef2 expression levels to account for cell size differences and selecting cells in the centre field of view (n\u00a0=\u00a0125 in replicate 1). Genes with mean copy numbers of >10 per cell were used. Lack of correlation was observed with both biological replicates, but only the cells in replicate 1 were shown to eliminate potential contributions from batch to batch variations. We counted the frequency of each of the measured loci within 300 nm of a voxel with an active or speckle zone assignment (zone 1 and 2), normalized by the total number of voxels that were within 300 nm of the DNA locus. The PCC was computed between the z-scored expression value and the active/speckle zone association frequency. To randomize the sample, we shuffled the z-score normalized expression values with active or speckle zone occupancy from different cells over 20 randomized trials. The correlation coefficient for each gene was calculated and plotted in Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 8n.To calculate the correlation between intron expression levels with zone assignments in single cells, we classified the corresponding DNA loci as \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 based on whether introns were bursting at that loci or not for 13 introns measured. The genes with mean burst frequencies of >0.1 per cell were used. Then the active and speckle zone occupancy for loci in each category was calculated and shown in Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 8o with each point representing one intron.Colony analysisFor cells within the unlabelled E14 colonies, we compute the correlation of the immunofluorescence states, RNA states and chromosome structures between pairs of cells. Individual RNA levels were normalized by Eef2 expression level and then z-scored across all cells in the experiment. The chromosome proximity correlations between cells were computed as follows. First, a 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020 chromosome to chromosome proximity matrix was generated for each cell with a search radius of 2.5 \u03bcm. Then the correlations between cells were computed as the PCC of the entries of the two matrices. The intensity of individual immunofluorescence marks was first normalized by the total intensity of all immunofluorescence marks and then z-scored within each field of view. The averages of the cell pair correlation values for immunofluorescence, RNA and chromosomes are shown in Fig. 4e for 24 h and 48 h clonal tracing as well as controls (correlation of pairs of cells between colonies in the 24 h and 48 h data). In addition, we computed the variance of individual immunofluorescence marks within single colonies in the 48 h experiment compared to the variance between cells of different colonies. Immunofluorescence marks that have longer time scale correlation showed lower variance within colonies compared to the variance between colonies in Fig. 4f.Normalization of global chromatin levels in single cellsTo remove the contributions from cell size, background signals, the affinity of antibody used, as well as differences between biological replicates, we constructed a generalized linear model (GLM) for the sequential immunofluorescence data using the glm() function in R, which had been used to adjust for systematic bias in single cell RNA sequencing data77,78,79, for each chromatin mark \\(i\\), using a Gaussian error distribution:$$\\log \\,{Y}_{i}\\,\\approx \\,{\\beta }_{0}+\\sum _{j}{\\beta }_{j}{X}_{j}\\,$$in which Yi represents the vector of total fluorescence intensity of chromatin mark i across all cells, and Xj is a vector of latent variables contributing to the systematic bias in global chromatin states quantification. We included cell size, total fluorescence intensity over all chromatin marks per cell, experimental replicate ID and field of view (FOV) ID as latent variables in the GLM, and used the Pearson residuals of each fitting as the corrected standardized values of single cell chromatin state.Characterizing the heterogeneity of global chromatin states in single cellsWe next described the global chromatin heterogeneity between single cells using the adjusted total fluorescence intensities derived from above. Our single-cell global chromatin data has less profiled features, and without the sparsity commonly seen in many of the single cell RNA-seq datasets, we were able to directly calculate pairwise similarity of single cells from the adjusted data matrix. A k-nearest neighbour (kNN) graph was computed from the cell\u2013cell Euclidean distance with k\u00a0=\u00a010 without the four cell cycle markers (geminin, H4K20me1, H3pSer10 and H4K16ac). The kNN graph was used as the input for UMAP70 for 2D visualization (Extended Data Fig. 9d), and was also subsequently transformed into a shared nearest neighbour (SNN) graph for Leiden clustering80, with the resolution parameter set to 0.8. The Seurat81 functions FindNeighbours() and FindClusters() were used.We then included four markers of cell cycle processes in the analysis: geminin, H4K20me1, H3pSer10 and H4K16ac20,82. We constructed a principal curve83 which worked as a nonlinear summary of multi-dimensional data, using the function principal_curve() from the R package princurve. Using the projected values onto the principal curve as ordered cell cycle states, we found that H4K20me1 and H4K16ac displayed opposite continuum across single cells (Extended Data Fig. 9f), suggesting that the principal curve depicted a progression from G2/M to S phase.Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity of single cellsSimilar to global chromatin states quantification, we constructed a GLM for individual gene expression vector in RNA data, with cell size, total profiled transcripts per cell, experimental replicate ID and FOV ID as latent variables. Pearson residuals were taken as the corrected and standardized expression values.Given that the majority of mRNA species in this dataset are pluripotency and differentiation genes (for example, Nanog, Pou5f1 and Dnmt3a), we were interested in whether cells could be ordered pseudo-temporally in transcriptional states. We used a diffusion map84,85 to infer a low-dimensional manifold of RNA seqFISH data with the package destiny86, and the first diffusion component in rank was taken as a measurement of pseudotime. All the profiled genes were used to construct pseudotime, except for Cx3cr1, Npy, S100b and Zfp352 (maximum transcript count less than 10 in a cell). To visualize the continuum transcriptional and global chromatin data with respect to pseudotime progression, for every transcript and chromatin mark, we performed a local polynomial regression fitting with span\u00a0=\u00a00.75 and degree\u00a0=\u00a02 and generated the fitted values (Extended Data Fig. 9h).Mapping RNA seqFISH data to scRNA-seq resultsTo evaluate whether transcriptional states of mouse ES cells from seqFISH were comparable to those measured by single cell RNA-seq, we constructed a support vector machine (svm) model for mapping seqFISH data to existing scRNA-seq results. Specifically, scRNA-seq data42 was downloaded from ArrayExpress, and we retrieved quantifications for cells cultured in serum/LIF condition for analysis. The top 2,000 most variable genes were identified based on dispersion, based on which we ran a principal component analysis (PCA) and used the top 30 components as input for Leiden clustering80, with the resolution parameter set to 0.8 in the Seurat81 function FindClusters(). For data alignment between mouse ES cells quantified by the two technologies, we performed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to project the two datasets onto a shared space, followed by L2 normalization, using genes detected by both scRNA-seq and seqFISH (40 mRNA markers in total). The aligned data was for svm training and prediction, where the classifier was trained on cells captured by scRNA-seq with tenfold cross validation, and cluster labels were subsequently transferred to aligned seqFISH data. For joint visualization, we performed UMAP on the L2-normalized CCA embeddings for all cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b).Statistics and reproducibilityCells shown in Figs. 1b\u2013d, 2a, 4a, Extended Data Figs. 4a, 5a, b are representative of the 446 cells imaged in 2 biological replicates. Cells shown in Fig. 3 are representative of 201 cells and 172 cells in two independent experiments. Cells shown in Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 10a are representative of n\u00a0=\u00a0117 cells in the 48-h dataset.Network analysisTo investigate the relationship of gene and chromatin markers, we first calculated the pairwise PCC of different genes and chromatin markers using a scaled mRNA/antibody \u00d7 cell matrix (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Then, the results were represented as a network, where a gene\u2013gene, chromatin mark\u2013chromain mark or gene\u2013chromatin mark pair were connected if the PCC was greater than 0.4. The network was visualized using Cytoscape87, and the widths of edges in network were weighted by 100|PCC| to highlight the edges with high correlation (Extended Data Fig. 9i).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\n\n\nData availability\nThe source data and processed data from this study are available at Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3735329).

Samples are fixed with paraformaldehyde, followed by oligonucleotide-conjugated primary antibody incubation, post-fixation with paraformaldehyde and BS(PEG)5, and RNA seqFISH. Then samples are prepared for DNA seqFISH+. This optimized protocol ensures good alignment between DNA seqFISH+ data with RNA seqFISH and the multiplexed immunofluorescence data on a voxel by voxel level (Extended Data Fig. 2). Bottom right cartoon shows imaging routine for RNA FISH and DNA seqFISH+ with primary probes and sequential immunofluorescence with oligonucleotide-conjugated primary antibodies. b, Schematics of DNA seqFISH+ for the 1-Mb resolution dataset. Five rounds of barcoding allows 2,048 barcodes to be detected with 2 rounds of dropout error correction in each fluorescent channel. Two fluorescent channels are used to cover a total of 2,460 loci, spaced approximately 1 Mb apart in the genome. In each round of barcoding, 16 rounds of hybridization are performed to generate 16 pseudocolors. DNA dots detected in each pseudocolor channel are fitted in 3D to determine their super-resolved centroid location and compiled across all 16 pseudocolors to generate a super-resolved localization image. With 5 rounds of barcoding (overall 80 rounds of serial hybridizations), the identity of all DNA loci are decoded. Every DNA locus should appear once in every barcoding round in a single pseudocolor. The barcoding table (Supplementary Table 2) is shown on the right. DNA seqFISH+ probes contain all 5 rounds of barcode readout sequences. Each sequence, for a given barcoding round, has a possible choice of 16 sequences, corresponding to one of the pseudocolors. For each gene, 5 out of the 80 hybridizations will result in hybridization events and fluorescent readout probes bound on the primary DNA hybridizing probes. To preserve the DNA primary probe on the chromosome over all 80 rounds of hybridizations, the primary probes are padlocked62,63 onto the chromosomes by T4 DNA ligase at the primer binding sites after the initial hybridization (Methods). c, Barcode scheme for the 25-kb resolution DNA seqFISH+. 60 adjacent 25-kb regions are sequentially readout and imaged in 60 rounds of hybridization. This is carried out in parallel on 20 chromosomes. In other words, each round of hybridization images 20 different loci on different chromosomes. An additional 20 rounds of hybridization are carried out to label each chromosome one at a time to assign chromosomal identity to each locus imaged during the first 60 rounds individually. The 1-Mb resolution data were collected in the 643-nm (channel 1) and 561-nm (channel 2) channels in b, while the 25 kb resolution data were collected in the 488-nm channel (channel 3) in c.Extended Data Fig. 2 Optimization and validation for DNA seqFISH+.a, Ligation and post-fixation of primary probes prevent their dissociation at the readout probe stripping step, validated by telomere DNA FISH. 55% formamide wash buffer (WB) solution at 37\u2009\u00b0C was added to the cells for 16 h with and without the primary probes padlocked62,63 onto the chromosomal DNA. Probes were retained in the ligated sample, and not retained in the unligated sample. Note that 55% WB was used at room temperature for 2 min in each stripping step during the seqFISH routine, which is less stringent than the condition used here. b, Quantification of the signal retention after the harsh wash in a, with telomere DNA FISH across multiple conditions. Total intensities in individual nuclei from a single z-section were compared before and after the harsh wash. In the DNA seqFISH+ experiments, the condition with ligation and post-fixation was used. The number of cells from two independent measurements is written in the plot. For the box plots in b and g, the centre line in the boxes marks median, the upper and lower limits of the boxes mark the interquartile range, the whiskers extend to the farthest data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the grey points mark outliers. c, Primary probes are still bound after more than 81 rounds of hybridization, and the specific signals return in the DNA seqFISH+ experiments. Initial hyb0 for DNA seqFISH+ was performed with hyb80 readout probes for comparison. Fiducial markers targeting a repetitive region of the genome with a single primary probe were also imaged initially and included in all 80 imaging rounds for alignment. d, Quantification of the fiducial marker intensities for 80 hybridization rounds in the DNA seqFISH+ experiments, relative to that from hyb0 fiducial markers. Fiducial markers (n\u00a0=\u00a0506-1,117 dots per hybridization round) from 446 cells in DNA seqFISH+ experiments were used for quantification. Shaded regions represent the mean (centre) with s.d. e, Localization errors of fiducial markers across hyb 1 to 80 in the DNA seqFISH+ experiments, n\u00a0=\u00a071,981 aligned spots for x and y, and n\u00a0=\u00a087,879 aligned spots for z from 446 cells in DNA seqFISH+ experiments. For x and y alignments, we filtered out aligned dots that were more than 2\u00d7\u00a0s.d. away from the mean displacement at each hybridization, and new alignments were computed. f, Preservation of the nuclear structure through the double fixation procedure. Good colocalization (yellow in the right panel) of the nuclear speckles (SF3A66) before and after heating. g, Quantification of the SF3A66 immunofluorescence signal retention in the nuclei (left) and localization precision (right) measured by Pearson correlation of pixel intensities in the nuclei with a single z-section between hyb0 (pre-DNA seqFISH+ steps) image and hyb40 (pre-DNA seqFISH+ steps) or hyb130 (post-DNA seqFISH+ steps). n\u00a0=\u00a0326 cells in the centre field of views from two DNA seqFISH+ biological replicates in g\u2013k. h, Frequencies of on- and off-target barcodes in channel 1 and 2 per cell. On average, 3,636.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01,052.6 (median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) on-target barcodes and 14.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 off-target barcodes are detected per cell (n\u00a0=\u00a0326 cells from the centre field of views of the two biological replicates). i, Average frequencies of individual on-target and off-target barcodes (n\u00a0=\u00a04,096 barcodes in channel 1 and 2), demonstrating the accuracy of the DNA seqFISH+. j, The total number of dots detected in each of the fluorescent channels in single cells. Channels 1 and 2 contain the 1-Mb data and channel 3 contains the 25-kb data. k, The average number of dots detected per each locus per cell across all 20 chromosomes. Note that 2 dots per cell are not 100% detection efficiency because some cells are in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (4 alleles in total). X chromosome has half the number of dots detected per locus (0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21 (median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.)) compared with the other autosomes (1.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27), because E14 mouse ES cells are a male diploid cell line (Methods). l, Pearson correlation of probabilities for the pairs of loci within a search radius of 500 nm (1-Mb data) and 150 nm (25-kb data) between two biological replicates of DNA seqFISH+ experiments. All unique intra-chromosomal pairs of loci were calculated for the 1-Mb (n\u00a0=\u00a02,460 loci) and 25-kb data (n\u00a0=\u00a01,200 loci) with n\u00a0=\u00a0201, 245 cells for biological replicates 1 and 2, respectively. m, PCC of the proximity probability between loci pairs as a function of search radii in comparison to 500-nm search radius (1-Mb data) and 150-nm search radius (25-kb data) used in l. n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells from the two DNA seqFISH+ biological replicates.Extended Data Fig. 3 Additional validation for DNA seqFISH+.a, b, Spearman correlation between probabilities of pairs of loci within a search radius of 100 nm\u20132 \u03bcm by DNA seqFISH+ and frequencies by Hi-C23 in mouse ES cells with a certain bin size. All unique intra-chromosomal pairs of loci were calculated for the 1-Mb (n\u00a0=\u00a02,340 autosomal loci) and 25-kb data (n\u00a0=\u00a060 loci per chromosome), and overlapping regions within the bin in a were excluded from this analysis. At 1.5 Mb chromosomal regions with 25 kb resolution in b, median Hi-C reads vary depending on the 1.5 Mb regions targeted, ranging from 0.9 to 203.2. We used 5 autosomal regions with Hi-C reads greater than 40 per 25-kb bin for comparison. c, Comparison of probabilities within 500-nm search radius for intra-chromosomal locus pairs in autosomes in DNA seqFISH+ (1-Mb resolution data) and the frequencies in Hi-C23 data in mouse ES cells. Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.89 computed from n\u00a0=\u00a084,707 unique intra-chromosomal pairwise combinations. Hi-C data were binned with 1-Mb data, and overlapping regions within 1 Mb were excluded from this analysis. d, Comparison of probabilities within a 500-nm search radius for the intra-chromosomal locus pairs in autosomes by DNA seqFISH+ (1-Mb resolution data) and frequencies by SPRITE7 in mouse ES cells. Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.83. The same binning and filtering were used as the Hi-C analysis in c. e, Comparison of probabilities within 150-nm search radius for the locus pairs in the selected autosomes by DNA seqFISH+ (25-kb resolution data) and frequences by Hi-C23 in mouse ES cells. Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.82 to 0.94 computed from n\u00a0=\u00a0948\u20131,776 unique pairwise combinations, using the same selection and filtering criteria as b. f, g, Relationships between median spatial distance of pairs of loci for 1-Mb resolution data in f and 25-kb resolution data in g by DNA seqFISH+ and Hi-C frequencies. The red lines are power-law fits with fitting parameters S shown with Spearman correlation coefficient R. h, i, Heat maps showing probabilities of pairs of loci within a search radius of 500 nm in h and 150 nm in i (top right triangles), and median spatial distances of pairs of loci (bottom left triangles) in each chromosome for 1 Mb resolution data in h and 25-kb resolution data in i by DNA seqFISH+. n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells from two biological replicates for DNA seqFISH+ data in a\u2013i.Extended Data Fig. 4 Single-cell organization and physical scaling of chromosomes by DNA seqFISH+.a, DAPI staining image of mouse ES cells (top) and 3D image of corresponding nuclei with individual chromosomes labelled with different colours (bottom). b, 3D image of individual chromosomes, coloured based on chromosome coordinates (light to dark colours). Chromosomes are from cells in a. The images are representative of n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells profiled with DNA seqFISH+. c, d, Scaling of median spatial distance as a function of genomic distance for 20 chromosomes with 1-Mb resolution data in c and 25-kb resolution data in d. Grey dots represent the median distance of the given pairs of loci. Blue dashed lines are the median spatial distance at each genomic distance bin, while red lines are power-law function fits with the fitting parameters in the plots. n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells. e, The full spatial proximity map between all loci from the 1-Mb DNA seqFISH+ data with a search radius of 1 \u03bcm (bottom left triangle panel). The zoomed in view of the map for chr6 and chr7 (top right panel), showing the non-repetitive regions near pericentromeric repetitive regions from different chromosomes are more likely to be spatially close to each other. Colour bar is shown in log scale. f, Mean spatial proximity map for 20 chromosomes, considering only the first 5 Mb non-repetitive regions in each chromosome with a search radius of 1 \u03bcm. g, Distribution of coefficient of variation (CV) for spatial proximity from inter-chromosomal pairs in f. h, Single cell version of spatial proximity maps in f show heterogeneity in the spatial proximity between the proximal 5 Mb non-repetitive regions of the chromosomes. i, Single nuclei image shows that proximal 5 Mb non-repetitive regions from only a subset of chromosomes appear near the DAPI-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin regions in individual nuclei. The images are representative of n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells and the analysis are quantified from 2 biological replicates in e\u2013h.Extended Data Fig. 5 Visualization and validation for sequential immunofluorescence and repetitive element DNA FISH.a, 17 antibodies and 4 repetitive elements, including gene-poor long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE1), gene-rich short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEB1), centromeric MinSat, and telomeres, are imaged along with DAPI. Individual cells have different patterns of immunofluorescence staining. Note that the DAPI patterns are not identical between cells. Similarly, marks that are colocalized with DAPI-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin regions are different between cells and even between different pericentromeric regions in a single cell. b, Representative H3K9ac image and edge-transformed image that detects the voxels on the exterior of H3K9ac globules (Methods). c, Representative H3K9ac images from a single z-section or maximum intensity z-projection with the intensity Z-score threshold above 2. 3D visualization (right) was performed for the pixels with the intensity Z-score above 2 (Methods). d, Additional single cell 3D images of immunofluorescence markers for the pixels with the intensity Z-score above 2. Heterochromatin components (H3K9me3, DAPI and MinSat) were clustered together, while RNAPIISer5-P, active marks (H3K9ac, H3K27ac), SINEB1 and nuclear speckles (SF3A66) were physically proximal. High intensity pixels of LINE1 by DNA FISH localized mainly to the LINE1-rich X chromosome88. e, Correlation of chromatin profiles for all 2,460 loci at 1 Mb resolution generated from distance to the interior and exterior voxels of different immunofluorescence marks (n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells). f, Scatter plots of the distances from each locus to interior voxels versus exterior voxels that are 2\u00d7\u00a0s.d. above the mean for 2,460 loci at 1-Mb resolution (n\u00a0=\u00a0446 cells).

Individual voxels with the 15 chromatin markers are clustered with hierarchical clustering and visually represented by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique (UMAP)70. Voxels from individual clusters (zones) are mapped back to individual nuclei, and overlaid with DNA seqFISH+ dots. b, UMAP representation for 44,000 pixels sampled from 201 cells, labelled with 12 zones. UMAP projection is used for visual clarity. c, Pearson correlation matrix between zones and interfaces based on the DNA loci association with zones and interfaces shown in f (n\u00a0=\u00a02,460 loci). Loci appearing in zone 1 are also more likely to be found in zone 2 as well as in interface 1/2. d, Comparison of zone appearance with and without DNA seqFISH+ treatment shows an overall agreement between the measurements. Mean values from 20 bootstrap trials are shown with error bars corresponding to standard errors. e, Assignment of zones as a function of downsampling of immunofluorescence markers. Twenty random subsets of immunofluorescence markers are selected at each downsample size. The centre of the curve reflects the mean and the width reflects the standard deviation of the correct zone assignments at each downsample size (Methods). f, Reconstructions of zones and DNA loci in additional cells. g, Reconstructions of zones in the cell 31 with different z-planes. h, Reconstruction of zones and 1,000-gene intron dots as well as RNAPIISer5-P staining (background-subtracted) and edge of RNAPIISer5-P staining. i, Heat map for probability of association between DNA loci, nuclear zones and interfaces for the 1-Mb data. Zones and interfaces are ordered according to the overall probability of association with DNA loci. Right panel shows the loci around Pou5f1 visualized in Fig. 3b (panel 1). Each locus in single cells is assigned to one zone or interface. The distribution shown in the heat map reflects the single cell variability in zone association for each locus. For example, Ehmt2 and Pou5f1 loci were primarily associated with active zone 2 and interfaces 1/2 and 2/3, whereas Opn5 and Dazl loci were more uniformly distributed across many zones. j, Heat map for probability of association between DNA loci, nuclear zones and interfaces for the 25-kb data. Loci within the same Mb region have similar nuclear zone and interface association probability. k, Frequency of association between DNA loci and zones or interfaces in single cells, calculated for all loci, loci with intra-chromosomal and interchromosomal pairs, TAS measured by intron FISH, and random loci (randomized control).

Population level expressions are taken from bulk RNA-seq studies49 and integrated for a 1-Mb region. For the box plots, the centre line in the boxes marks median, the upper and lower limits of the boxes mark the interquartile range, the whiskers extend to the farthest data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the grey points mark outliers. n, Correlation of mRNA levels and fraction of voxels within 300 nm of a given locus in single cells being in active zones for individual mRNAs. Mean values from 20 bootstrap trials are shown with error bars corresponding to standard errors for each mRNA. Randomized samples correspond to scrambling of mRNA and zone assignment values for each cell. o, Comparison of fraction of voxels within 300 nm of DNA loci to be in active zones (zone 1 and 2) for loci with an active intron signal (ON) versus loci with no intron signal (OFF) for individual introns.

Error bars show standard errors for 20 bootstrap trials. Tbx3 and Nanog are more homogeneous within colonies, consistent with previous findings of the long-lived transcriptional states of these genes across several generations by single-cell live-imaging experiments41,49. n\u00a0=\u00a0117 unlabelled cells within colonies from a 48-h dataset. c, Histogram of cell-to-cell correlations of chromosome to chromosome proximity maps for cells within colonies (red) and between colonies (grey). Cells with similar chromosome structures (red dots with high correlation values) are likely to be sister cells. The y-axis represents PCC, computed by 20 \u00d7 20 chromosome proximity matrices from pairs of cells.

The accompanying Matters Arising paper from Cembrowski and Spruston questions the spatial organization described for\u00a0CA1 and raise concerns that the results were determined only by high expression, non-barcoded genes. In response, we show that the same robust spatial structure is observed when only lower average abundance genes measured by barcoded seqFISH are used. In fact, many genes with low average abundance are informative of cell states because they can be expressed strongly in specific subpopulation of cells. Our discussion highlights the importance of single-cell in\u00a0situ analysis in resolving cellular and spatial heterogeneities otherwise lost in population-averaged measurements.

While RNA-seq has replaced microarrays as the de rigueur method for genomics studies because of its higher sensitivity and dynamic range, reverse transcription and other steps needed to generate cDNA sequencing libraries from RNA can introduce biases in RNA quantitation. Moreover, nucleotide-level sequences are not necessary for measuring transcript abundance. smFISH3,4, which involves the direct hybridization of DNA oligonucleotide probes to transcripts in cells, can be used to quantitate mRNA abundance with high sensitivity and accuracy.Here, we demonstrate transcriptome-level profiling of mRNAs with single-molecule sensitivity and high accuracy using a method based on sequential FISH (seqFISH)5. We showed previously that seqFISH can be used to image hundreds of transcripts in cells and tissues6, to image chromosome dynamics7, and to track cell lineages with single-cell resolution8. However, the major limitation of seqFISH is that the optical diffraction limit prevents many mRNAs from being resolved simultaneously in single cells. In principle, super-resolution microscopy9 and expansion microscopy10 can resolve optical density issue in situ. However, many applications quantify mRNAs that have been extracted from cells and tissues. In these cases, we can solve the problem of optical crowding by capturing transcripts onto an oligo(dT) surface and adjusting the dilution factors, thus allowing seqFISH to decode the transcriptome.To distinguish this in vitro application from in situ seqFISH, we refer to this approach as RNA SPOTs. As a demonstration, we extracted mRNA from mouse cells, captured transcripts on a locked nucleic acid (LNA) poly(dT)-functionalized coverslip (Fig. 1a) and then hybridized with a pool of 323,156 primary probes targeting the coding regions of 10,212 mRNAs with 28 to 32 probes per gene (Fig. 1a,b; Supplementary Table 1; see Online Methods). To barcode the 10,212 genes with sequential hybridization, we used a 12 'pseudocolor' scheme, such that four rounds of barcoding were sufficient to cover the transcriptome (124 = 20,736) (Supplementary Table 2), with an additional round of error correction to compensate for a drop in any single round of barcoding6 (Fig. 1c\u2013d). The pseudocolor design shortens the number of barcoding rounds, which reduces the error in barcode readout.Figure 1: Transcriptional profiling in vitro with RNA SPOTs.(a) mRNA is captured on a locked nucleic acid (LNA) poly(dT)-functionalized coverslip, and gene-specific primary probes (323,156 total) are then hybridized against the 10,212 targeted mRNAs. Each gene is targeted by 28\u201332 primary probes. (b) Each 149-nt primary probe includes a 25-nt gene-specific sequence complementary to the mRNA, four 20-nt barcodes (A,B,C, and D)\u2014each encoding one of 12 'pseudocolors') which are read out by fluorescent secondary readout probes, single T-nucleotide spacers between readout and gene-specific regions, and two 20-nt PCR primer binding sites. Note that probes for each gene are divided into subsets in which sites A, B, C, and D may correspond to round I, II, III and IV or V, I, II, III, etc. to ensure the gene is measured in every round. (c) Each of five barcoding rounds is based on 12 pseudocolors, which are read out by four serial hybridizations. In each serial hybridization, three readout probes conjugated to Alexa 647, Alexa 594, or Cy3b are hybridized to the primary probes, imaged, and extinguished. Images from four serial hybridizations are then collapsed into a single composite 12-pseudocolor image representing one round of barcoding. Sets of four serial hybridizations are repeated for five barcoding rounds (I to V) for a total of 20 hybridizations. This corresponds to 124 = 20,736 codes, with an extra round of barcoding to correct for mishybridizations. (d) Digitized composite images based on actual experiments to decode 10,212 distinct mRNA. White dashed squares, correctly identified barcodes; red dashed squares, false positives; yellow dashed squares, barcodes identified despite mishybridization in one round of hybridization. Scale bars: overview, 10 \u03bcm; rounds I to V barcoding, 1 \u03bcm.Full size imageTo implement the pseudocolor scheme, we designed primary probes to contain a 25-nt RNA-binding sequence as well as four overhang sites11 that can be bound by dye-labeled readout oligos (Fig. 1b). Each site has 12 possible sequences corresponding to the 12 pseudocolors. To read out the 12 pseudocolors, three of the readout oligos were hybridized at a time, imaged in the Cy3b, Alexa 594, and Alexa 647 fluorescence channels; and this was repeated four times to iterate through all 12 readout sequences, and disulfide cleavage12,13 was performed between the hybridizations to remove the fluorophores (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).With five rounds of barcoding using the 12 pseudocolor readout scheme, a total of 60 readout oligos were used to decode the 10,212 genes targeted (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and Supplementary Table 3). Each set of primary probes that target a specific gene contain five unique readout sequences that are spread out over the overhang sites (Fig. 1b). A total of 20 rounds of hybridization, or five barcoding rounds that each contained four serial hybridizations (Supplementary Fig. 1), were performed. A common sequence was present in all primary probes and targeted by an oligo labeled with Alexa 488 to serve as an alignment marker through all 20 rounds of hybridization (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Each set of four serial hybridizations was collapsed into a single image with 12 pseudocolors (Fig. 1c). The barcodes were determined from aligning five barcoding rounds of the pseudocolor images.The switching and rehybridization time is fast, and the overall speed is limited by imaging speed. Typically, 100\u2013200 fields of view containing more than 106 mRNAs can be imaged with 20 rounds of serial hybridization in a 14-h period through an automated fluidics system. We use spots per millions (SPM) to normalize spot counts for individual genes between experiments (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The false-positive rate of detection is low, 0.72 \u00b1 1.9 SPM per barcode, as determined by the remaining 238,620 off-target barcodes.To determine the accuracy of the transcriptome-level measurements, we compared the decoded RNA SPOTs data with RNA-seq data for mouse fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs); and we found correlations of R = 0.86 and R = 0.9, respectively (Fig. 2a,b; Supplementary Fig. 5; and Supplementary Table 4). Between two replicates of RNA SPOTs in fibroblasts, the results agree with R = 0.94, which indicates that RNA SPOTs is a highly robust and reproducible measurement method (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, 7). Finally, RNA SPOTs correlated with the gold-standard smFISH quantitation with a correlation of R = 0.86 in mESCs (24 genes)14 and R = 0.88 in fibroblasts (7 genes) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8).Figure 2: RNA SPOTs is accurate and efficient.(a) Transcriptomic profiling of mouse NIH/3T3 cells by RNA SPOTs correlates strongly with measurement from RNA-seq. SPM (spots per million) normalizes the number of each decoded mRNA spots (n = 581,772) by the total number of spots. FPKM, fragments per kilobase per million reads. (b) RNA SPOTs profiling of mouse ES-E14 cell line strongly agrees with RNA-seq measurement. (n = 1,688,747 spots). (c) Comparison of two RNA SPOTs replicates profiling NIH/3T3 cells illustrates that the method is highly reproducible (n1 = 581,772 spots; n2= 453,679 spots). (d) Comparison of averaged smFISH copy numbers of 24 genes in ES-E14 cells with RNA SPOTs SPM verifies the high-accuracy measurement of SPOTs. Error bars represent s.e.m. across different measurements in single cells. (e) Differential gene expression between NIH/3T3 and ES-E14 cells. P values smaller than 0.05 as determined from two-tailed student t-test and log2 fold change greater and less than \u00b12, respectively, are used as a threshold for significance. Magenta dots represent top 50 upregulated and top 50 downregulated genes between the two cell lines. Blue dots represent the well-known genes involved in pluripotency. Cyan dots represent the genes involved in maintenance of extracellular matrix.Full size imageComparing genes that were differentially expressed in fibroblasts versus mESCs, we observed the same trend that we did in those detected by RNA-seq. For example, using RNA SPOTs we found that pluripotency factors such as Rex1 (also known as Zfp42), Esrrb, and Sox2 are highly expressed in mESCs but are not expressed in fibroblasts. Similarly, genes involved in extracellular matrix maintenance such as Timp2 and Timp3 and collagen-related genes such as Col4a1 and Col6a3 are upregulated in fibroblast cells compared to mESCs (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 6).Another advantage of RNA SPOTs compared with RNA-seq is that specific sets of genes can be selectively profiled with RNA SPOTs. In this way, profiling of ribosomal RNA and highly expressed housekeeping genes can be avoided simply by eliminating those probes from the gene set. As each dot detected in our assay corresponds to a single mRNA, RNA SPOTs is more efficient in term of imaging compared with RNA-seq, where many sequencing reads are needed to determine the abundance of a transcript. The current barcoding space is sufficient to encode the entire transcriptome, and noncoding RNAs and other RNAs lacking polyA tails can be captured in hydrogels (Supplementary Fig. 9) rather than with dT oligos.RNA SPOTs offers advantages over existing Nanostring technology15 because of its genome-level coverage and higher specificity due to the larger number of probes used per gene. By incorporating amplification methods such as HCR6,16, RNA SPOTs signal could potentially be imaged faster with air objectives at throughputs comparable to that of RNA-seq.By combining RNA SPOTs with microfluidics tools to trap and lyse cells17 or with split-pool molecular-indexing methods18, our method can be scaled down to single-cell input levels. While RNA SPOTs cannot be used to discover new RNA sequences, the identification of new cell types only requires that the combinatorial expression of genes be quantified. Thus, there is no need to resequence mRNA molecules at the nucleotide level just to count abundances. The human transcriptome can be profiled using the RNA SPOTs scheme shown here. In addition, with targeted RNA SPOTs, we can choose to probe only the set of 2,000 transcription factors conserved in humans and mouse19 or 1,000 informative landmark genes20 in single cells instead of profiling the transcriptome, thus making it possible to capture essential information while increasing the number of cells sampled. As cost of sequencing is a limiting factor in many genomics experiments, RNA SPOTs enables an accurate and low-cost alternative to sequencing with many applications that go beyond RNA to DNA and proteins.MethodsStep-by-step protocol.A detailed protocol for RNA SPOTs is available at the Protocol Exchange21 and as a Supplementary Protocol.Primary probe design.Gene-specific primary probes were designed as previously described with some modifications6. Probe sets were crafted separately for each gene and then refined as a full set to mitigate cross-hybridization in the experiment. Individual probe sets were first crafted using exons only from within the CDS region of the gene. For genes that did not yield enough targeted probes from the CDS region only, exons from both the CDS and 5 UTR regions were used. The masked genome and annotation databases from UCSC were used to look up the gene sequences. Consensus regions of all spliced isoforms were identified. 25 nt sequences of the gene sequences were extracted from these exons, and their GC contents were calculated. Probe sequences that fell outside of the allowed GC range (45\u201370% in this case) were immediately dropped. In addition, we dropped any probe sequences that contained five or more consecutive nucleotide bases of the same kind. A local BLAST query was run on each remaining probe against a BLAST database that was constructed from GENCODE-reversed introns and mRNA sequences. BLAST hits on any sequences other than the target gene with a 15-nt match were considered off-target hits. We compiled a collection of RNA-seq data from ENCODE and computed a copy-number table for all the genes across different samples. This off-target copy-number table was used to evaluate the off-target hits. Any probe that hit an expected total off-target copy number exceeding 10,000 FPKM was dropped. Probes were sequentially dropped from genes until any off-target gene was hit by no more than six probes from the entire pool. At this stage, all of the viable probes for the gene had been identified. For the final probe set, the best possible subset from the viable probes was selected such that none of the final probes were within 2-nt bases of each other on the target sequence. The overlapping probes were grouped and sorted by distance from the target GC content (55% in this case). Overlapping probes were removed in order of descending distance from target GC, starting from the probe with the greatest distance, until no overlaps remained. To minimize cross-hybridization between probe sets, a local BLAST database was constructed from all the viable probe sequences, and the probes were queried against it. All matches of 17 nt or longer between probes were removed by dropping the matched probe from the larger probe set. For this experiment, the targeted probe set size range was set to 28\u201332 probes. Any probe set with more than 32 probes was trimmed down by removing probes with the farthest distance from the targeted 55% GC content. To design the 20 nt readout sequences, a set of probe sequences was randomly generated with the combinations of A, T, G, or C nucleotides. Readout probe sequences within a range of 45\u201360% GC were selected. We used BLAST to eliminate any sequences that matched with any contiguous homology sequences longer than 14 nt to the mouse transcriptome. The reverse complements of these readout sequences were included in the primary probes according to the designed barcodes.Primary probe construction.Primary probes were ordered as oligoarray complex pools from Twist Bioscience and were constructed as previously described6,11,22. Briefly, two-step limited PCR cycles were used to amplify the designated probe sequences from the oligo complex tool. Then, the amplified products were purified using QlAquick PCR Purification Kit (28104; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were used as the template for in vitro transcription (E2040S; NEB) followed by reverse transcription (EP7051; Thermo Fisher) with the forward primer. After alkaline hydrolysis, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were purified by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in primary probe hybridization buffer comprised of 30% formamide (F9037; Sigma), 2\u00d7 SSC (15557036; Thermo Fisher), and 10% (w/v) Dextran Sulfate (D8906; Sigma). The probes were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C.Readout probe synthesis.20 nt readout probes were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) as 3 thiol modified at its oxidized form. Alexa Fluor 647 Cadaverine (A30679; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 594 Cadaverine (A30678; Invitrogen) were reacted with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate, SPDP (P3415; Sigma) at a 1:100 ratio in 1\u00d7 PBS (AM9624, Ambion) at room temperature for at least 4 h on a shaker. Then, the mixture was purified using PD MiniTrap G-10 (28-9180-10; GE Healthcare) and was evaporated in a vacuum concentrator. The dye-linker intermediate product was kept at \u221220 \u00b0C until the conjugation with 3\u2032 thiol oligonucleotide probes. 10 mM TCEP (77720; Thermo Scientific) was used to activate the 3\u2032 thiol readouts at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then the oligonucleotides were purified using illustra NAP-5 columns (17-0853-02; GE Healthcare), and the oligonucleotides were directly eluted in 1\u00d7 PBS with 10mM EDTA (15575020; Thermo Fischer) and were mixed with the dye-linker intermediate product. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the mixture was ethanol precipitated, HPLC purified, resuspend into 500 nM concentration in 1\u00d7 Tris-EDTA buffer (93283; Sigma) and was kept at \u221220 \u00b0C. To conjugate Cy3B fluorophore (PA63101; GE Healthcare) to the 3\u2032 thiol oligonucleotides, a (3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionyl hydrazide), PDPH (22301; Thermo Fisher) was used instead of the SPDP linker.Coverslip functionalization.Coverslips were functionalized as previously described17 with some modifications. Briefly, coverslips (3421; Thermo Scientific) were sonicated in 100% ethanol for 20 min. After drying, the coverslips were cleaned with a plasma cleaner at HIGH (PDC-001, Harrick Plasma) for 5 min. Then, the coverslips were immediately immersed in a 2% (v/v) trimethoxysilane aldehyde (PSX1050; UCT Specialties) solution made in pH 3.5 10% (v/v) acidic ethanol solution for 15 min at room temperature. After triple rinsing of the coverslips with ethanol, the coverslips were heat cured at 90 \u00b0C for 10 min. Then, an oligonucleotide reaction mixture containing 2.5 \u03bcM 5\u2032-aminated LNA-oligo(dT) (300100-02; Exiqon), cyanoborohydride coupling buffer (C4187; Sigma), and 1 M sodium chloride (AM9759; Thermo Fisher) was sandwiched between two coverslips at room temperature in a humid hybridization chamber for 3 h. The coverslips were then rinsed with Millipore water and dried with compressed air. A quenching reaction mixture made from 10% (v/v) 100 mM pH 7.5 Tris\u2013HCl (15567027; Thermo Fischer) buffer in cyanoborohydride coupling buffer was added to the entire silanized surface of the coverslips to quench the remaining aldehyde functional groups at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the coverslips were rinsed with water and dried with compressed air. All coverslips were made fresh before SPOTs experiment.Cell cultures and RNA preparation.Mouse ES-E14 cells were cultured as previously described14. Mouse NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (10569044; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (S11150; Atlanta biologicals) and 1% penicillin (10378016; Gibco). Once the cell confluency reached 60\u201380%, the total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (74104; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Hydrogel immobilization.Coverslips were first sonicated at 100% ethanol for 20 min, followed by plasma cleaning with a plasma cleaner at HIGH for 5 min. The coverslips were then immersed in the 2% (v/v) PlusOne bind-silane(17-1330-01) solution made in ethanol for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing the coverslips with ethanol several times, the coverslips were dried at 90 \u00b0C for 30 min. Purified total RNA was mixed in 4% acrylamide/bis solution (1610147; Bio-Rad) with fresh 25 mM VA-044 initiator (27776-21-2; Wako Chemical), and the solution was degassed for 10 min on ice. A 12 mm square coverslip (470019-000; VWR) was functionalized with GelSlick (Lonza; 50640). 1 \u03bcL of the RNA hydrogel solution was added to the bind-silane-functionalized coverslip and was spread out using the GelSlick functionalized square coverslip. The thickness of the hydrogel formed can be controlled by manipulating the volume added. The polymerization happened in a humid hybridization at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. After polymerization is complete, the coverslips were immersed in 2\u00d7 SSC for 1 h or more to facilitate the removal of the top coverslips. smFISH measurement was then performed according to standard protocol.Primary probe hybridization.A custom Secure Seal Flowcell, 2 \u00d7 28 mm 3 mm ID, 35 \u00d7 15 OD, 0.25 mm thick (RD478685-M; Grace Bio-labs) was applied on the functionalized poly(dT) coverslips. For NIH/3T3 cells experiments, 50 ng of total RNA in RNA-binding buffer comprised of 1 M LiCl (L9650; Sigma), 40 mM pH 7.5 Tris\u2013HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (93443; Sigma), and 20 U of SUPERase IN RNase Inhibitor (AM2694, Ambion) was captured at room temperature for 1 h. For ES-E14 experiments 1 and 2, the amount of total RNA used was 50 ng and 5 ng, respectively. Once the mRNA was immobilized on the coverslip, 20 \u03bcL of 1 nM/probe for a total of 323,156 probes in hybridization buffer containing 30% formamide (F9037; Sigma), 2\u00d7 SSC (15557036; Thermo Fischer), and 10% (w/v) Dextran Sulfate (D8906; Sigma) was hybridized to the targeted mRNA at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h in a humid hybridization chamber. After hybridization, the sample was washed for 30 min at room temperature with wash buffer containing 40% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC, and 0.1% Triton X-100 to eliminate nonspecific binding of the primary probes. The sample was then washed three times with 2\u00d7 SSC and kept in 2\u00d7 SSC until the next step.RNA SPOTs imaging.Each readout probe hybridization mixture contained 10 nM each for three unique readout probes either conjugated to Alexa 647, Alexa 594 or Cy3b in hybridization buffer comprising 10% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC, and 10% (w/v) Dextran Sulfate (D4911; Sigma). Each serial hybridization takes 15 min to achieve optimal fluorescent signals followed by a 4 min high-stringency wash containing 20% formamide and 2\u00d7 SSC to remove nonspecific binding of probes. Once the first hybridization is complete, the flow cell was connected to an automated fluidics delivery system made from two multichannel fluidics valves (EZ1213-820-4; IDEX Health & Science) and a peristaltic pump (NE-9000G-UP, New Era Pump Systems Inc.). The integration of the fluidics valves, peristaltic pump, and microscope imaging were controlled through a custom script written in Micromanager software. Once the flow cell is connected, \u223c100 to \u223c200 frame of views (FOVs) were imaged at 647 nm, 594 nm, 532 nm, and 488 nm channels with 500 ms exposure time under antibleaching buffer containing 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8 (15568025; Thermo Fischer), 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM Trolox (238813; Sigma), 0.8% glucose (G7528; Sigma), 3 U/mL pyranose oxidase (P4234; Sigma) or 50 U/mL of glucose oxidase (G2133; Sigma), and 20 U/mL SUPERase IN RNase Inhibitor. The antibleaching buffer was stored under a layer of mineral oil (M5904; Sigma) throughout the whole experiment. Imaging was done using a standard epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti Eclipse with custom-built laser assembly), a Nikon 60\u00d7 oil objective and an sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2; Andor). Nikon Ti Eclipse PFS autofocus was activated to keep the plane focused during imaging. Once the imaging was complete, reduction buffer made from 50 mM TCEP (646547; Sigma), 2\u00d7 SSC, and 0.1% Triton X-100 was flowed into the flow cells, and the solution was allowed to incubate for 5 min. Then, 2\u00d7 SSC buffer supplemented with 20 U/mL SUPERase IN RNase Inhibitor was flowed into the flow cell in excess for 4 min to completely remove the TCEP solutions. As our flow cell takes only \u223c22 \u03bcL of solution, 200 \u03bcL of subsequent serial hybridization solutions were flowed into the flow cell each time to ensure hybridization. The whole process was repeated until 20 rounds of hybridizations were imaged. Generally, a SPOTs experiment takes \u223c14 h for imaging 100\u2013200 FOVs. After the SPOTs imaging is complete, a few FOVs were imaged to use for threshold and illumination background corrections in image analysis. A multispectral beads slide was imaged at the end of experiment for chromatic aberration corrections.Image processing.To remove the effects of chromatic aberration, multispectral beads were first used to create geometric transforms to align all fluorescence channels. Next, the background illumination profile of every fluorescence channel was mapped using a morphological image opening with a large structuring element. These illumination profile maps were used to flatten the illumination in postprocessing, which resulted in relatively uniform background intensity and preservation of the intensity profile of fluorescent points. The background signal was then subtracted using the ImageJ rolling-ball background-subtraction algorithm with a radius of 3 pixels. Finally, the calculated geometric transforms were applied to each channel.Image registration.As the Alexa 488 channel labeled all the spots in the FOV, this channel was used to align all sets of images using a normalized 2D-image cross-correlation.Barcode calling.The potential RNA signals were then found by finding local maxima in the image above a predetermined pixel threshold in the registered images. Once all potential points in all channels of all hybridizations were obtained, dots were matched to potential barcode partners in all other channels of all other hybridizations using a 1 pixel search radius to find symmetric nearest neighbors. Point combinations that constructed only a single barcode were immediately matched to the on-target barcode set. For points that matched to construct multiple barcodes, first the point sets were filtered by calculating the residual spatial distance of each potential barcode point set, and only the point sets giving the minimum residuals were used to match to a barcode. If multiple barcodes were still possible, the point was matched to its closest on-target barcode with a Hamming distance of 1. If multiple on-target barcodes were still possible, then the point was dropped from the analysis as an ambiguous barcode. This procedure was repeated using each hybridization as a seed for barcode finding, and only barcodes that were called similarly in at least four out of five rounds were used in the analysis. The number of each barcode was then counted, and transcript numbers were assigned based on the number of on-target barcodes present. The remaining barcodes were used to assess the rate of false positives by running through the same process. All image processing and image analysis code can be obtained upon request.smFISH.Unless stated, all smFISH measurements were conducted with 1 nM/probe concentration with a total number of 24 probes targeting a gene in hybridization buffer comprising of 10% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate at 37 \u00b0C. The probes were conjugated to either Alexa 647, Alexa 594 or Cy3b dyes. NIH/3T3 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (28908; Sigma) in 1\u00d7 PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After washes with 1\u00d7 PBS, the cells were permeabilized using 70% ethanol and kept at \u221220 \u00b0C. The probe sequences for each gene were designed using Stellaris Biosearch Technologies, and the probes were ordered from IDT with 5\u2032 amine modifications. The probes were conjugated to dye as previously described5. After hybridization, the sample was washed with wash buffer supplemented with 30% formamide and 2\u00d7 SSC at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then stained with DAPI (D1306; Thermo Fischer) in 2\u00d7 SSC, and this was followed by imaging under antibleaching buffer. The cells were segmented, and the copy numbers for each gene were counted using a custom Matlab script.RNA-seq.RNA-seq data23 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with an accession number of GSE98674. Briefly, the total RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The library was constructed using NEBNext ultra RNA-seq (E7530; NEB) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500. Base calls were performed with RTA 1.13.48.0 followed by conversion to FASTQ with bcl2fastq 1.8.4. Alignment was performed using TopHat algorithm. Transcript assembly and FPKM estimates were performed using Cufflinks algorithm.Statistics and reproducibility.The technical replicates for RNA SPOTs of NIH/3T3 and ES-E14 are two in both cell cultures. The R values in the plots of technical replicates and SPOTs versus RNA-seq are Pearson's r correlation coefficient. For smFISH average measurements, the error bars represent the s.e.m. For differential gene expression analysis, two-tailed student t-test is carried out with n = 2 for mean SPM for both NIH/3T3 and ES-E14. P values smaller than 0.05 and log2 fold change greater and less than \u00b12 are used as a threshold for significance.A Life Sciences Reporting Summary for this publication is available.Data and software availability.The raw data for one field of view used to generate Figure 2 are available at Zenodo.org, doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1030239.

A round of barcoding involves 4 serial hybridizations, each of which uses three unique secondary readout probes fluorescently labeled to Alexa 647, Alexa 594, and Cy3b dyes. The images from each 4 rounds of serial hybridizations are collapsed to form each 12-pseudocolor composite image which are aligned to decode for the barcoded RNA species.Supplementary Figure 2 Fluorescent switching through cleavage of disulfide conjugate dye on readout probes is highly efficient.(a) 20 rounds of hybridization are accomplished by extinguishing fluorescent signals through reduction of disulfide conjugated dye to readout probes using TCEP, followed by re-hybridization of next unique secondary readout probes. (b) Both priming regions (grey in the probe schematic) used in synthesizing gene specific primary probes are also used as a registration marker through the hybridization of Alexa 488 conjugated readout probes. Majority of the fluorescent spots stay even after 20 rounds of hybridizations. The amide bond between the Alexa 488 dye (shown in yellow) and primer readout probes used as a registration marker is not affected by TCEP. (Scale bars: 2\u03bcm.) (c) The fluorescent signals in each channel after treatment of 50mM of TCEP for 5 minutes at room temperature is reduced to minimal to none. (Scale bars: 5\u03bcm.)Supplementary Figure 3 Raw images of 20 rounds of fluorescent switching in channel 647.Bright dots are the real targets while dim dots are due to nonspecific binding. The switching between each round of hybridization is complete, with minimal retention of fluorescent signals from previous round. (Scale bars: 2\u03bcm.)Supplementary Figure 4 Assessment of primary probes non-specific binding.(a) Raw images of 532 channel with the presence of mRNA on coverslips through LNA poly(d)T capturing. (b) No bright fluorescent signals are observed in the absence of mRNA on coverslips as a control. The left image has the same contrast as (a) while the right image contrast has been increased 4.5 fold to illustrate better the non-specific fluorescent signals. (c) Quantitative measurement of fluorescent intensity in channel 647 with and without the presence of mRNA. A threshold can be set to distinguish between the two populations to identify the real signals. (d) & (e) same as (c) but for channel 594 and channel 532.Supplementary Figure 5 RNA SPOTs at lower depth.(a) Correlation between RNA-seq FPKM and RNA SPOTs SPM from another replicate is high when a total of 376,781 spots are counted. SPM, spots per million; FPKM, fragments per kilobase per million reads. (b) High reproducibility of RNA SPOTs between the two replicates in profiling ES-E14 cell gene expression (n1=376,781 spots, n2=1,688,747 spots).Supplementary Figure 6 Linear plots for Figure 2.(a) Correlation between RNA SPOTs and RNA-Seq for NIH/3T3 cells. (b) Zoomed-in boxed region in (a). (c) Reproducibility between two SPOTs replicates. The dashed line corresponds to the y = x line. (d) Zoomed-in boxed region in (c). (e) Correlation between RNA SPOTs and RNA-Seq for ES-E14 cells. (f) Zoomed-in boxed region in (e).Supplementary Figure 7 RNA SPOTs has little bias in GC content and transcript length.(a) Hexbin plot of NIH/3T3 mean SPM (n=2) shows no obvious trend with transcript GC content. (b) Transcript length does not bias RNA SPOTs detection. (c) Same as (a) but for genes with < 1 FPKM. (d) same as (b) but for genes with < 1 FPKM. (e) Boxplots of different groups of genes with different expression levels against transcript GC content. n = 1360, 2323, 1473, 2645 for each group from left to right. Center line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range; points, outliers. (f) Boxplot of SPM against transcript length. (g) Replicate plot of SPOTs as shown in Fig 2b. (h) Simulated replicates with Poisson noise. The total number of simulated SPOTs (n1=447,094, n2=448,249) was set to match the experimental replicates. (i). SPOTs data from two sets of field of views (FOVs) from the E14 experiment 3, x-axis contains 25 FOVs (n1=269,459 spots), y-axis contains another 25 FOVs (n2=295,403 spots).Supplementary Figure 8 smFISH measurement in single cells correlates with RNA SPOTs measurement in NIH/3T3 cells.(a) Raw images of the 7 genes measured by smFISH in NIH/3T3 cells. (Scale bars: 5\u03bcm.) (b) The averaged RNA smFISH counts agrees with RNA SPOTs SPM (spots per million) with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88, indicating RNA SPOTs quantitation is accurate. Error bars represents the standard error of the mean (SEM) across different single cells.Supplementary Figure 9 mRNA can be immobilized by polyacrylamide hydrogel on a bind-silane treated coverslips.(a) mRNA is trapped in the hydrogel mesh once acrylamide and bis-acrylamide monomers crosslink completely on the coverslip. (b) smFISH detection of ACTB once the total RNA is captured on a coverslip through LNA poly(d)T capturing (left) or polyacrylamide hydrogel (right). Negative control (channel 488) shows that the fluorescent signals are not coming from nonspecific sources.

Recent work has revealed that some transcription factors are activated in stochastic pulses of nuclear localization, rather than at a constant level, even in a constant environment [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In such cases, signals control the mean activity of the transcription factor by modulating the frequency, duration, or amplitude of these pulses. Although specific pulsatile transcription factors have been identified in diverse cell types, it has remained unclear how prevalent pulsing is within the cell, how variable pulsing behaviors are between genes, and whether pulsing is specific to transcriptional regulators or is employed more broadly. To address these issues, we performed a proteome-wide movie-based screen to systematically identify localization-based pulsing behaviors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screen examined all genes in a previously developed fluorescent protein fusion library of 4,159 strains [13] in multiple media conditions. This approach revealed stochastic pulsing in ten proteins, all transcription factors. In each case, pulse dynamics were heterogeneous and unsynchronized among cells in clonal populations. Pulsing is the only dynamic localization behavior that we observed, and it tends to occur in pairs of paralogous and redundant proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that pulsatile dynamics play a pervasive role in yeast and may be similarly prevalent in other eukaryotic species.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)2Co-first authorCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to lack of reliable techniques to perform transcriptional profiling in intact tissues, it remains controversial whether the neural crest is a heterogeneous or homogeneous population. By coupling multiplex single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization with machine learning algorithm based\u00a0cell segmentation, we examine expression of 35 genes at single cell\u00a0 resolution in vivo. Unbiased hierarchical clustering reveals five spatially distinct subpopulations within the chick dorsal neural tube. Here we identify a neural crest stem cell niche that centers around the dorsal midline with high expression of neural crest genes, pluripotency factors, and lineage markers. Interestingly, neural and neural crest stem cells express distinct pluripotency signatures. This Spatial Genomic Analysis\u00a0toolkit provides a straightforward approach to study quantitative multiplex gene expression in numerous biological systems, while offering insights into gene regulatory networks via synexpression analysis.\n\n\n\nIntroductionA central question in developmental biology is how individual stem cells acquire the ability to differentiate into multiple and diverse cell lineages. In vertebrate embryos, neural crest cells represent a prime example of a cell type that rapidly transits from an undifferentiated to differentiated state via progressive gene regulatory changes1. During the process of central nervous system (CNS) formation, this stem cell population first becomes apparent within the neural folds during neural tube closure by expression of characteristic transcription factors, including Pax7, FoxD3, Snai2, and Sox10. After undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), neural crest cells exit the neural tube to become migratory cells that home to discrete locations in the periphery and differentiate into diverse cell types, including neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes of the skin, and cartilage and bone of the face2.While cell lineage tracing experiments have shown that the premigratory neural crest contains multipotent cells that give rise to numerous derivatives3,4,5, there remain arguments in the literature regarding the balance between multipotency and early restriction in neural crest cell fate6, 7. Similarly, questions remain regarding the nature, location, or even existence of a neural crest stem cell niche as well as the regulatory mechanisms underlying maintenance of stemness.Many of the transcription factors comprising the neural crest gene regulatory network are known1. Despite this, a systems level\u00a0view of the transcriptional program and the degree of cell to cell\u00a0heterogeneity within the dorsal neural tube remains poorly understood due to the challenge of monitoring the regulatory state of individual cells. Moreover, little is known about the expression of pluripotency factors, such as Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4, in the premigratory or migrating neural crest. To tackle this question in the past, conventional in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry have been routinely used to analyze transcript or protein co-expression. For example, immunolabeling with the neural crest markers FoxD3 and Pax7 in the neural folds reveals some overlapping expression but other cells that express one but not the other marker8. Although this might be interpreted as indicating heterogeneity of neural crest precursors, these approaches are qualitative and limited in resolution, specificity and numbers of molecules that can be concurrently identified. While the recent adaptation of RNA-seq to single cells partially compensates for these issues by enabling detailed transcriptional profiling at the individual cell level, a shortfall is that it does not provide spatial information or reliable detection of low copy number genes9,10,11,12.To circumvent these problems and enable analysis of subpopulations within the neural crest at the single cell\u00a0 level in vivo in the avian neural tube, we present an imaging based\u00a0Spatial Genomic Analysis\u00a0(SGA) pipeline, which utilizes multiplex analysis of gene expression at \u00a0single cell resolution in a manner that preserves spatial information. This has enabled identification of distinct previously uncharacterized neural crest populations in the developing dorsal midbrain. These include a neural crest stem cell niche comprised of cells with combined neural crest and pluripotency markers located around the dorsal midline, surrounded by cells that express neural crest markers without a pluripotent signature. More laterally, there is a neural stem cell domain that may represent a buffer zone of cells that can transit either to neural tube or neural crest domains. Our results provide fundamental insights into the stem cell characteristics of the neural crest in vivo by revealing spatially and transcriptionally distinct subdomains at single cell\u00a0resolution.ResultsTranscriptional profiling by SGAIn order to study multiplex gene expression in the premigratory neural crest, we used midbrain cross sections from avian dorsal neural tubes (Fig.\u00a01a). SGA was developed by combining sequential single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH)13,14,15 with hybridization chain reaction (HCR)16,17,18 to amplify signal strength for in vivo tissue applications, thus enabling simultaneous analysis of multiple transcripts on embryonic tissue sections. Transcripts for each gene are visualized with fluorescent DNA probes. For each round, five genes are detected with different fluorophores and imaged by spinning disc confocal microscopy. Probes are then removed by treating with DNase I19, and the hybridization is repeated here seven times, enabling identification of 35 genes (Fig.\u00a01b, c). To ensure RNA integrity, the first hybridization set was repeated after the multiplex routine with over 80% signal recovery rate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01A).Fig. 1Spatial genomic analysis applied to developing dorsal chick neural tube. a Tissue sections were acquired from the midbrain level of stage HH9 chicken embryos. Double immunostaining of the premigratory neural crest using antibodies to Pax7 and FoxD3 reveals a heterogeneous expression pattern. b A list of the 35 genes used in the study with their functional roles. c The multiplex rehybridization routine was performed as follows: for each round of hybridization, a set of (18\u201324) DNA probes amplified by using HCR are imaged by using five orthogonal channels. The probes are removed with DNase I treatment between each hybridization step. For the machine learning algorithm based\u00a0image analysis pipeline, each transcript is visualized as a single diffraction-limited dot in 3D space and filtered from background noise (blue dots are excluded from the analysis). Cell membranes are visualized by immunostaining (using antibodies to E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin). To ensure single\u00a0cell\u00a0 accuracy, we developed a computer program to perform cell segmentation based on the stained plasma membranes, and to align individual images between hybridization rounds based on morphological features of the tissue. Number of transcripts is counted with each segmented 3D cell and divided by the cell volume to normalize the data according to cell size variation. Scale bar, 10\u2009\u03bcmFull size image\nOne of the challenges of doing multiple rounds of rehybridization is ascribing transcripts to individual cells. To circumvent this problem for SGA, we developed a machine learning algorithm based\u00a0image analysis pipeline to segment individual cells and count the transcripts inside them with single molecule accuracy (Fig.\u00a01c, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01, and Supplementary Movie\u00a01). This serial SGA approach enables spatial transcriptional profiling in complex tissue samples at single cell\u00a0resolution, and can be easily implemented for as many as a hundred genes.The dorsal neural tube consists of five subpopulationsTo apply SGA to the neural crest system, we designed probes against genes associated with particular cell identities or regulatory states involved in neural crest development, including neural and neural crest markers, pluripotency factors, differentiation markers, and genes associated with cell proliferation or cell death (Fig.\u00a01b). These were then hybridized onto tissue sections through the midbrain region of chick embryos shortly after neural tube closure and at the onset of neural crest migration (7 somite stage, Hamburger and Hamilton HH stage 9, Fig.\u00a01a). Five samples from three different embryos were measured with ~250 cells per sample. Data were pooled to create a single heat map according to the z-scored expression values for each of the 35 genes (Fig.\u00a01).Unbiased hierarchical clustering analysis without prior spatial information revealed five distinct cell clusters (Fig.\u00a02a). When these were mapped back to the original tissue sections, they corresponded to five reproducible but previously unrecognized spatial subdomains in the dorsal neural tube (Figs.\u00a02b and 3b). Most cells with a premigratory neural crest signature localized to a heart shaped\u00a0 region bisected by the midline of the dorsal neural tube: the central-most portion expressed a combination of neural crest, pluripotency, and differentiation markers (NCstem, yellow), whereas the cells just lateral to that expressed neural crest \u201conly\u201d genes (NC, red). Cells with a migratory neural crest signature consisted of three distinct and spatially well defined\u00a0 subclusters (NCmig1\u20133, green). Interestingly, all NCmig cells express the epidermal marker Krt19 together with subsets of neural crest markers (Fig.\u00a03c). Lateral to the heart shaped\u00a0 neural crest cells, we find another population that has high expression of neural markers together with differentiation and pluripotency genes (Nstem, light blue). These neural stem cells are bordered by both the neural crest domain, and the more ventral neural (N, blue) cells, which only express neural genes. Accordingly, the two described stem cell populations (yellow and light blue) also have the highest expression of the proliferation markers Ccnd1 and E2f1 (Fig.\u00a02a, b). The relative expression levels of each gene are presented as a violin plot in Fig.\u00a03a.Fig. 2Hierarchical clustering reveals spatially distinct subdomains in the dorsal neural tube. a Pooled data from 1190 cells from 5 midbrain cross sections of three embryos reveal two main cell populations: stem cells that express both pluripotency and differentiation markers (yellow and light blue), together with cells without a pluripotent signature\u00a0(red and blue). These can be further clustered into different subpopulations of neural or neural crest cells. Migrating neural crest cells are in green. Vertical axis shows the relationships between the genes according to similarity in expression pattern. b Using SGA, single cells in the heat map can be mapped back to the embryo section to confer spatial information. Five clusters form reproducible spatial patterns in the dorsal neural tube. Neural crest stem cells (NCstem) are located around the dorsal midline and surrounded by neural crest cells without expression of pluripotency genes (NC). The migrating neural crest cells (NCmig1\u20133) express Krt19 and Msx2, and form a group of mesenchymal cells outside the neural tube (see also Fig.\u00a03c). Neural cells are found lateral to neural crest cells; neural cells with a pluripotent profile (Nstem) reflect a border zone between the neural crest and the neural cells (N). Schematic view shows the spatial location of the subdomains in the dorsal neural tube. Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcmFull size image\nFig. 3Reproducibility of subclusters between different embryos. a Violin plots show modality and gene expression levels for the 35 genes used in the study. Plots are based on Gaussian kernel density estimation and MatLab (R2015a v8.0) default settings for ksdensity command. b The five clusters (see heat map in Fig.\u00a02a with pooled data from five samples) form reproducible spatial patterns in the dorsal neural tube. Spatial mapping of the pooled clusters into two additional embryo sections reproduce the pattern seen in Fig.\u00a02b. c The early migratory neural crest population (shown in green in Fig.\u00a02) consists of three separate subpopulations (NCmig1\u20133) with spatially distinct locations. All populations express the epidermal marker Krt19, whereas the cells that emigrated first and have thus migrated the furthest express pluripotency markers and high levels of the neuroectodermal gene Pax6. The following populations (NCmig2\u20133) have high Msx2 expression. For the subcluster reproducibility analysis, five samples from three different embryos were compared and three representatives were chosen for the images (n\u2009=\u20095). Scale bar, 10\u2009\u03bcmFull size image\nDistinct pluripotency signature of two stem cell populationsConsistent with the previously described multipotent nature of premigratory neural crest cells4, 5, our results show that several pluripotency markers indeed are expressed in the dorsal neural tube (Fig.\u00a02). To further explore this finding, we clustered the data according to five pluripotency markers. Interestingly, the results show that different sets of pluripotency genes are associated with neural crest vs. neural populations. Whereas the medially localized neural crest cells express high levels of Nanog, PouV, and Klf4, the more lateral neural stem cells express high levels of Sox2 and Msi1 (Fig.\u00a04a\u00a0and Supplementary Fig. 2A).Fig. 4Analysis of functionally distinct genes reveals previously undescribed expression patterns within the dorsal neural tube. For each figure, all 1190 cells were clustered according to a subset of genes. Only the cells expressing the corresponding genes are shown in the clustergrams. A simplified table and schematic representation of the results is included in each panel. a Clustering using pluripotency markers separates neural vs. neural crest domains as shown by the hierarchical clustered heat map and the corresponding spatial mapping. Interestingly, these two domains express a different subset of stem cell markers, with neural crest cells predominantly\u00a0expressing Nanog, PouV, and Klf4. b Premigratory neural crest cells also express multiple lineage specific\u00a0 marker genes. Hierarchical clustering reveals heterogeneous expression profiles reflecting five subclusters. These groups form well defined\u00a0 and reproducible spatially distinct domains in the dorsal neural tube. The most dorsal cells (including both migratory neural crest and skin ectodermal cells) express high levels of the epidermal marker Krt19 (green). Another cluster consists of cells mainly expressing the cartilage lineage marker Col2a1, located dorsolaterally within the premigratory neural crest domain (purple). The dorsomedial domain expresses markers of all lineages examined except the neural stem cell marker MycN (orange). The basomedial domain expresses markers of all lineages including neural, glial, melanocytic, cartilage, and epidermal (yellow). As expected, the cells outside the heart-shaped neural crest domain predominantly express neural and glial genes (blue). c Finally, clustering using only neural crest markers reveals distinct expression profiles of migratory vs. premigratory neural crest cells. Premigratory populations generally express all neural crest markers, whereas the migratory cells were chosen based on their expression profile that have a consistent expression of Tfap2A, Tfap2B, Axud1, and Msx2. For the subcluster reproducibility analysis, five samples from three different embryos were compared and three representatives were chosen for the images (n\u2009=\u20095). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcmFull size image\nDifferentiation marker expression in the dorsal neural tubeDue to our finding that all five differentiation markers are co-expressed with the pluripotency markers, we asked whether the dorsal neural tube can be divided into subregions according to lineage marker expression (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02B). Interestingly, cells around the midline of the dorsal neural tube express all lineage markers (yellow) with the distinction that the more dorsally located cells do not express MycN (orange). Cells expressing markers for all lineages overlap with pluripotent neural crest cells (Fig.\u00a04b, compare to red cells in Fig.\u00a04a). High Col2a1-expressing cells (a marker for cartilage fate) that do not express other lineage markers clustered as an individual group and are located most laterally in the neural crest cell domain. These cells do not overlap with the pluripotent cells (purple cells in Fig.\u00a04b, compare with blue and red in Fig.\u00a04a). Cells with neural and glial features localize ventrolaterally and overlap with the neural stem cells (blue\u00a0cells\u00a0in\u00a0Fig.\u00a04b compare to blue cells in Fig.\u00a04a). In migratory neural crest cells (green), there is high expression of Krt19 but low expression of other lineage markers. However, some migratory cells also co-express single lineage markers individually (see heat map in Fig.\u00a04b) and some express pluripotency markers (compare green cells in Fig.\u00a04b with red cells in Fig.\u00a04a).Neural crest markers in different populationsWe also examined the differential expression profile of the premigratory vs. early migrating neural crest cells by parsing the data solely using neural crest genes. Interestingly, the clustering shows that the premigratory population expresses high levels of neural crest markers, including FoxD3, Sox9, Snai2 (aka Slug), and MycC, but that these were downregulated in early migratory cells, which predominantly expressed Msx2, TfAP2\u03b1, TfAP2\u03b2, and Axud1 (Fig.\u00a04c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02C).SGA provides insight into gene regulatory networksFinally, hierarchical clustering of genes revealed correlations between the expression profiles of neural crest genes in individual neural crest cells, indicating genes that are most likely to be transcribed in the same cells at the same time. For example, individual cells displayed synexpression of two subgroups of neural crest genes (Fig.\u00a05a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03): \u03b1 (Sox9, FoxD3, Snai2) and \u03b2 (Ets1,TfAP2\u03b1, TfAP2\u03b2, Axud1) clusters, which together represent a core set of neural crest genes, in accordance with previous reports showing co-operative roles for some of these genes20,21,22. On the other hand, the neural crest marker gene Sox10 clusters outside this core suggesting a separate role. Similarly, the complete 35\u2009\u00d7\u200935 correlation matrix of all genes shows highest correlation between the core neural crest genes (dark red), and anti-correlation (blue) between neural (MycN and Msi1) and neural crest genes (Fig.\u00a05b). Furthermore, the first two components of the principal component analysis (PCA) recapitulate these major findings regarding the relationships in gene expression of the 35 genes (Fig.\u00a05c). These first two components represent the majority (2/3) of the data variability. Further components become less significant with an additional increase of less than 5% each. The five different cell populations are well separated as their own groups in principal component space. Only the migratory cells (green dots) overlap with others, predominantly with the pluripotent (yellow) and nonpluripotent (red) neural crest cells. This is in line with the possibility that some of the migrating cells are already more progenitor-like (see heat map in Fig.\u00a02a). The genes of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 clusters are next to each other further confirming their similar synexpression profile. Finally, PCA highlights the genes with the most variability including the core neural crest genes as well as the neural stem cell markers Sox2 and Msi1 together with neural and glial markers MycN and Fabp7 (Fig.\u00a05c).Fig. 5Relationships between neural crest genes based on their co-expression patterns within individual cells. a Genes with similar expression profiles are more closely clustered on the dendrogram, suggesting regulatory relationships. Hierarchical clustering analysis of genes reveals a core neural crest cluster of seven genes that are the most likely to be expressed simultaneously in individual cells in the stage HH9 chicken embryo. The core cluster is further subdivided into two subclusters (\u03b1 and \u03b2). However, Sox10 has a different expression profile compared with the core neural crest genes and other SoxE genes. Sip1, Sox8, and Msx1 cluster even further away, suggesting a different function from the core neural crest genes. b The 35\u2009\u00d7\u200935 correlation matrix of all the genes from all 1190 cells. Red values reflect positive correlation, white means no correlation, and blue values reflect anti-correlation. c Plot of the first two components of principal component analysis (PCA). Cells are color coded according to their cluster definition in Fig.\u00a02 (neural crest \u201conly,\u201d neural crest stem cells, migratory neural crest, neural \u201conly,\u201d and neural stem cells). The positions of the cells indicate the relative score of each of the 1190 cells, scaled with respect to the maximum score value and maximum coefficient length. Black vectors indicate contribution of each of the 35 genes from the first two components. Note that the neural crest genes clearly separate from neural genes, and that Sox10 is separate from the core cluster of neural crest genes. Black solid lines around 0 are to be used as a guide for the eye. The greatest spread in genes is found in the principal component two. The 10 genes showing the highest absolute values of variability within the component are shown in the insert that clearly separates the core neural crest from the neural and glial genesFull size image\nDiscussionBy taking advantage of machine learning\u00a0algorithms for defining cell borders, we have developed a SGA approach for simultaneously and unambiguously imaging multiple diffraction limited\u00a0 transcripts within single cells with full spatial resolution. This is particularly important when dealing with challenging tightly adhered epithelial tissues such as the dorsal neural tube, where the cells are highly intermingled. Since alignment is based on morphological features detected by a computer program developed for this study, samples can be removed from the microscope allowing us to repeatedly measure multiple thick samples at the same time. By enabling simultaneous analysis of numerous genes in single neural crest cells in vivo, SGA reveals previously unknown position based\u00a0 differences in gene expression among premigratory and early migrating cranial neural crest cells. This has enabled characterization of a previously unknown pluripotent neural crest stem cell niche in the dorsal neural tube. In addition, this new spatial transcriptional profiling approach provides a useful tool that can be applied to a large number of tissues across a variety of biological systems.Combining multiplex gene expression with spatial information provides intriguing biological insight about distinct stem cell niches in the dorsal neural tube. Our data identify reproducible regulatory states associated with distinct dorsoventral and mediolateral positions that likely represent different functional zones within a heart shaped\u00a0 neural crest domain. These snapshots of transcriptional profiles suggest that there is position dependent\u00a0 gene expression in the dorsal neural tube. Whereas the medial most cells appear to represent a proliferative \u201cmother\u201d neural crest stem cell population, we speculate that these cells give rise to the more progenitor-like cells surrounding them.The single transcript level\u00a0sensitivity of our method allows quantitative and multiplexed measurement of low copy number genes, such as pluripotency markers, that previously were largely undetected in the dorsal neural tube due to limitations of conventional methods23 (Figs.\u00a02 and 3). Interestingly, we show that the pluripotent expression profile of neural crest stem cells (high Nanog, PouV, Klf4) differs from the neural stem cell signature (high Sox2 and Msi1), suggesting a different regulatory mechanism for these two stem cell populations. This is also in line with previous reports showing that repression of Sox2 is required for the maintenance of the neural crest fate24. High Sox2 levels may, in this context, rather than reflecting pluripotency, represent a neural stem cell status25, 26. Furthermore, our findings are in accordance with a recent report by Buitrago-Delgado and colleagues showing that the neural crest in Xenopus embryos retains Vent2 (frog equivalent to Nanog) expression and properties characteristic of the early blastula, suggesting that this may reflect a pan-vertebrate trait27.In contrast to reports on embryonic stem cells in which expression of pluripotency and lineage markers does not overlap28, 29, we note that many neural crest stem cells concomitantly express both, suggesting that they are open to many choices and/or have largely open chromatin (Figs.\u00a02 and 4 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Interestingly, while the pluripotent (Klf4, PouV, Nanog-positive) neural crest cells express all five different lineage markers, the expression of neural and glial lineage markers is dominant in neural stem cells (Msi1, Sox2-positive), suggesting a higher stem cell potential of the neural crest stem cells. Given that the same patterns are observed from embryo to embryo, rather than stochastic jumping between different states30,31,32,33, our results support the idea that there is a gradual transition as cells move between different regulatory states within the dorsal neural tube. Furthermore, our observation of pluripotency markers in some early migrating neural crest cells is consistent with previous studies showing that even migratory neural crest cells can contribute to multiple fates4, 5, 34, and share gene signatures similar to early blastula cells27.In parallel with the neural crest domains, we observed two different regulatory states within the neural population, an apparent neural stem cell population that borders the heart shaped\u00a0neural crest domain and a neural cell population that is more ventrally localized. Single cell\u00a0lineage analysis has shown that single neural tube cells can contribute to both the CNS and neural crest4, 5, and ablation experiments have shown a contribution from lateral regenerating neural tube cells to the neural crest domain35. Thus, the neural stem cells may represent a pool that can contribute to both the neural tube and neural crest.Finally, simultaneous gene expression analysis of all the commonly used neural crest markers shows that they are not expressed uniformly throughout the population, highlighting the importance of using appropriate markers when analyzing experimental results. Hierarchical clustering separates the premigratory and early migrating neural crest cells into two transcriptionally distinguishable subpopulations solely based on their expression of neural crest markers (Fig.\u00a04c). This provides valuable information regarding the potential roles of these markers. First, the fact that expression levels of FoxD3, Sox9, Snai2 (Slug), and MycC are significantly higher in the premigratory neural crest supports their role in stem cell maintenance, pluripotency, and promotion of EMT36,37,38,39,40,41. Second, the separation of neural crest markers into a \u201ccore\u201d neural crest cluster further confirms this diversity and suggests different functional roles for genes that lie within vs. outside of the core. Our data also show that multiplex single cell\u00a0 analysis can be used to evaluate synexpression groups that may help inform upon gene regulatory network relationships within a given tissue (Fig.\u00a05).In summary, we have developed a single molecule imaging based\u00a0SGA pipeline and used it to reveal previously unknown stem cell populations in the dorsal neural tube of developing chick midbrain. Our results provide a valuable link between systems biology and classical developmental biology, revealing quantitative information of the developing neural crest. This pipeline can be easily implemented to address many biological questions in multiple organisms.MethodsSample preparationSeven somite stage (Hamburger Hamilton HH stage 9) chicken embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight +4\u2009\u00b0C, dehydrated in ethanol overnight (\u221280\u2009\u00b0C), washed 3\u00d7 with PBS-0.2% Triton, and brought to OCT embedding compound (Tissue-Tek 4583) via a 20% sucrose gradient (3\u2009h on a nutator +4\u2009\u00b0C). The embryos were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and 12\u201316\u2009\u03bcm-thick midbrain cross sections were cut and collected to aminosilane-coated (>98%, Aldrich) #1.5 coverslips.SGA protocolProbes were designed as follows: mRNA-binding sequences were designed as a reverse complement of the coding DNA sequence region of the mRNA transcript with minimum of five base separations between the probes and CG-content being between 40 and 60%. When possible, we used 24 probes per gene with the minimum number being 12 for Fabp7. The probes were blasted (NCBI) to assure their specificity and the probes were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies. We designed DNA probes based on previously described HCR initiator sequences17. A 18\u201320\u2009nt long mRNA-binding sequence and a four base linker sequence were added to the 3\u2032 end of each DNA probe (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Hairpins were ordered from Molecular Probes and we used five orthogonal channels (Cy7, Alexa647, Alexa594, Cy3b, and Alexa488) for single molecule imaging.HybridizationBefore starting a multi-day hybridization routine, we tested RNA integrity by using a probe set (Snai2, 24 probes) where every other probe was labeled with a different initiator sequence. They were then amplified with two orthogonal channels and the diffraction limited\u00a0dots showed better than 80% colocalization. After the multiplexed hybridization routine, the first set of genes was repeated at the end of the hybridization rounds. Routinely, a more than 80% recovery of the dots further confirmed the RNA integrity over the entire experiment.All the hybridizations and imaging were done inside hybridization chambers (Grace Bio-Labs, volume ~\u200950\u2009\u03bcl) attached onto an aminosilane-coated #1.5 cover glass. OCT-medium embedded\u00a0embryos were treated and fixed on cover glasses by washing the sample several times with 1% PFA in 1\u00d7 PBS. The samples were then permeabilized with 0.5% SDS in 1\u00d7 PBS for 10\u2009min and postfixed with 1% PFA in 1\u00d7 PBS for 10\u2009min. Background autofluorescence was reduced by treating the samples with 1% NaBH4 in 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u2009min and washed several times with 2\u00d7 SSC prior hybridization.The samples were blocked with 1\u2009\u03bcM random 60\u2009nt DNA oligomers in 2\u00d7 SSC for 1\u2009h and the hybridization was performed in chambers at 100% humidity at 37\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The probe concentration was 1\u2009nM per individual probe in 10% high molecular weight dextran sulfate (DS) and 30% formamide (FA) in 2\u00d7 SSC. Thiomerisal (0.01%) was added to the hybridization solution to prevent fungal and bacterial growth. The next day, the samples were washed with 30% FA in 2\u00d7 SSC (3\u00d7) following a SSC wash (2\u00d7).The fluorescent signal was amplified using HCR with corresponding hairpins in 10% DS/2\u00d7 SSC solution for 1.5\u2009h at room temperature, followed by washes (3\u00d7) with 30% FA 2\u00d7 SSC and 2\u00d7 SSC yielding a diffraction limited\u00a0signal for each transcript. The samples were costained with DAPI during the first hybridization round and the samples were imaged under Pyranose Oxidase enzyme (Sigma P4234)based anti-bleaching buffer. After imaging, the DNA probes and the hairpin polymers were digested with 1\u2009h DNase I treatment (0.5\u2009U\u2009/\u00a0\u03bcl\u22121, NEB Biolabs M0303) followed by three times 30% FA 2\u00d7 SSC (3\u00d7) and 2\u00d7 SSC (3\u00d7) washes. The routine was repeated for each additional set of hybridizations.ImmunostainingIn order to define the cell borders for cell segmentation in the dorsal neural tube, cell membranes were immunostained using two separate antibodies against two membrane proteins (\u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin) to achieve uniform and maximal signal strength. To avoid RNase contamination during the hybridization phase, the immunostaining was performed last according to standard protocol. The samples were blocked with 5% BSA in 1\u00d7 PBS-0.2% Triton and 1% DMSO for 1\u2009h at room temperature and incubated over night +4 \u00b0C\u00a0with antibodies to E-cadherin (610181; BD Biosciences 1:1000) and \u03b2-catenin (Abcam ab6301clone15B8, 1:750). The sections were then washed 5\u00d7 with PBS-0.2% Triton and incubated 3\u2009h at room temperature with the respective secondary antibodies with the same fluorophore (Alexa647 goat anti-mouse IgG2a and Alexa647 goat anti-mouse IgG1, 1:1000) and washed for imaging.ImagingImaging was performed with Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal unit on an Olympus IX-81 microscope using six orthogonal channels. The dyes and their respective laser excitation lines used were: Cy7 (727\u2009nm), Alexa647 (640\u2009nm), Alexa594 (589\u2009nm), Cy3B (532\u2009nm), and Alexa488 (473\u2009nm) for single molecule imaging (sm) and DAPI (405\u2009nm) for nuclei and fluorescent background imaging. Typical exposure time was 500\u2009ms. The camera was back-illuminated CCD Andor iKon-M 934 BEX2-DD that offered a high quantum\u00a0efficiency (>90%) in a broad spectral range from ultraviolet (400\u2009nm) to near-infrared (850\u2009nm). Pixel size of the camera was 13\u2009\u00d7\u200913\u2009\u03bcm and the sensor array consisted of 1024\u2009\u00d7\u20091024 pixels. Z-axis was imaged with 0.5\u2009\u03bcm intervals and voxel size (unit volume) was thus 8.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009\u03bcm3. Olympus 10\u00d7 UPlanFL N 0.3 NA air objective was used for sample alignment and large field\u00a0of view fluorescence imaging. Images were captured through an oil immersion objective Olympus 100\u00d7 UPlanSApo 1.4 NA. The channels are fully orthogonal. In order to achieve this, we have used laser illumination and the dichroic and emission filter sets were carefully chosen. We filtered out the noise from the background by excluding the dots with the weakest intensity due to nonspecific binding of the probes (typically consisting of less than 5% of all the dots). Motorized and computer controlled\u00a0sample mounting stage ASI MS-2000 was used to move and tile the samples when necessary. Image acquisition was performed with a Micro Manager software (v. 1.4.18). Epifluorescence images were captured with the similar system as described above but without the spinning disc confocal unit.Image analysisWe created a machine learning based\u00a0image analysis pipeline to identify single-cell outlines from 3D image stacks. Briefly, the membrane label stain and autofluorescence background was used to train a random forest classifier42 that resulted in prediction maps of the cell interiors (Fig.\u00a01c). Using thresholding on these prediction maps, and performing post filtering based on size, we obtained cell interiors that were used as seeds for a watershed algorithm43 implemented in MatLab (R2015a v8.0) program. Watershed algorithm provided 3D cell outlines and cell label matrixes that were used as masks for further analysis. This cell segmentation method created a volumetric space for each cell that was filtered out according to Gaussian distribution providing a representative 3D cell population of the tissue section. The majority of the filtered cells were 75% or more intact (see Supplementary Movie\u00a01). We used the same machine-learning software for transcript detection, and the MatLab program counted the dots in segmented cells. The dots are diffraction limited and even in the case of the highest copy number gene \u03b2-actin, the dots were non-overlapping. Cell size and the transcript detection thresholds were filtered to accept cell sizes and transcript intensities that followed the Gaussian distribution. Typically, we filtered out <5% of the cells and transcripts depending on the copy number of the corresponding gene. The absolute copy numbers of transcripts were divided with a cell volume to take into account different cell sizes due to a natural variability and the presence of partial cells in the sections. Image alignments were done in an automated fashion using the MatLab software developed for this purpose and corrected manually when necessary. Code is available at www.singlecellanalysis.org or at https://github.com/CaiGroup/neuralcrest.Data analysisGene expression heat maps and PCA plots were generated based on the z-scored gene expression data using a MatLab program. Hierarchical clustering analysis was done in two dimensions with a cosine similarity between the pairwise objects in the distance matrix. In order to normalize the natural variation of transcript levels between different embryos, pooled data from separate experiments were z-scored prior to pooling. Subsets of cells and/or genes were picked for further analysis and reclustered accordingly using the same clustering method. Cluster groups were mapped back to the spatial domain and visualized by using our MatLab program.Data availabilityThe authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its\u00a0Supplementary Information files or from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\n\n\nReferencesSimoes-Costa, M. & Bronner, M.

However, current approaches to label multiple genomic loci in live cells have a fundamental limitation in the number of loci that can be labeled and uniquely identified. Here we describe an approach we call \u201ctrack first and identify later\u201d for multiplexed visualization of chromosome dynamics by combining two techniques: CRISPR imaging and DNA sequential fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization. Our approach first labels and tracks chromosomal loci in live cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, then barcodes those loci by DNA sequential fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization in fixed cells and resolves their identities. We demonstrate our approach by tracking telomere dynamics, identifying 12 unique subtelomeric regions with variable detection efficiencies, and tracking back the telomere dynamics of respective chromosomes in mouse embryonic stem cells.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u00a9 2017 Biophysical Society.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

We show that chromophore substitution generates a fluorescent Arch complex with a 200-nm bathochromic excitation shift relative to ATR-bound wild-type Arch and an emission maximum at 772\u00a0nm. Directed evolution of this complex produced variants with pH-sensitive NIR fluorescence and molecular brightness 8.5-fold greater than the brightest ATR-bound Arch variant. The resulting proteins are well suited to bacterial imaging; expression and stability have not been optimized for mammalian cell imaging. By targeting both the protein and its chromophore, we overcome inherent challenges associated with engineering bright NIR fluorescence into Archaerhodopsin. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for engineering non-natural, tailored properties into microbial opsins, properties relevant for imaging and interrogating biological systems.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (132KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordssynthetic chromophore substitutiondirected evolutionprotein engineeringnear-infrared fluorescenceArchaerhodopsinlive-cell imagingLoading...Recommended articlesCited by (0)3Co-first author4Lead Contact\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownLoading...Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

SeqFISH has enabled the detection of a large number of mRNA species in single cells1, and a recent implementation using binary sequential barcodes demonstrated the multiplexing of 100\u20131,000 transcripts in single cells2. Exciting in situ sequencing approaches can also decode RNA species with nucleotide-level resolution3,4. However, barcoding a large number of transcripts can result in a high density of spots within the cell, which makes it difficult to resolve individual spots and identify barcodes across the hybridizations. We previously demonstrated that super-resolution microscopy improves the detection of abundant RNA molecules5, and others have used advanced algorithms including compressed sensing to assist super-resolution microscopy6,7. However, a robust method to decode high-copy-number RNAs or other densely labeled molecules with conventional fluorescence microscopy is needed.Here, we use image correlation to decode seqFISH temporal barcodes. In a simple example, we encode three RNA species such that each species only appears in a unique combination of two out of three total hybridization (Hyb) rounds (Fig. 1a). If a given RNA has a Hyb2 and Hyb3 code, only the FISH spots corresponding to that RNA will be detected in the same positions between Hyb2 and Hyb3; crosscorrelating Hyb2 and Hyb3 images will generate a positive correlation for that RNA, with an amplitude that is proportional to the number of molecules, while the other RNA species will not contribute to the crosscorrelation. Thus, the copy number of an RNA can be extracted from the crosscorrelation of the images corresponding to its barcode assignment even when the images are dense. We have made custom MATLAB source codes for corrFISH quantification (Supplementary Software) and test images available (https://github.com/singlecelllab/correlationFISH).Figure 1: Correlation FISH.(a) Schematic of sequential hybridizations of dense, barcoded mRNA molecules. RNA A is labeled in Hyb1 and Hyb2 and produces positive pairwise correlations across these two hybridization rounds but does not contribute to correlation between Hyb2 and Hyb3, in which only RNA B is labeled. Rehyb, rehybridization. Correlation peak values across Hybs (1,2) and (2,3) are estimators of the copy number of RNA A (NA) and B (NB), respectively, in that cell. Corr, correlation. (b) Simulated images of a cell with 1,000 A molecules in the presence of 10,000 B and C molecules in Hyb1 and Hyb2, respectively. The image correlation peak value (red arrow and 3D plot) corresponds to the copy number of A. Scale bars, 5 \u03bcm. (c) Correlation accurately estimates simulated RNA levels even at high density of RNAs, unlike localization-based dot counting. (d) Accuracy of detecting 100, 1,500, and 3,000 copies of A in the presence of increasing concentrations of B and C in simulated data (n = 20 simulation runs). Dashed line, expected number of A transcripts. (e) Experimental images of a cellular region with labeled transcripts of gene A (NA) in the presence of four uncorrelated, labeled transcripts (NB\u2013E) and (NF\u2013I) in Hyb1 and Hyb2, respectively. The correlation functions yields transcript A abundance. Scale bars, 5 \u03bcm. (f) Gene A transcript detection in five-gene experiments using two different corrFISH barcodes (M1: Hyb1*Hyb2 and M2: Hyb2*Rps2 from Hyb3) with a linear fit of R = 0.83 and P < 0.002 (Student's t-test), n = 43 cells. (g) smFISH and corrFISH counts of transcript A are correlated. Inset, correlation R = 0.86 and P < 0.0006 (Student's t-test) in the linear regime, where smFISH quantification is not saturated.\nSource data\nFull size imageTo test this approach, we simulated images corresponding to two rounds of hybridization with only one RNA in common between the two images (mimicking 30- \u00d7 30-\u03bcm cell size) and a ten-fold excess of uncorrelated RNAs (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Crosscorrelation between Hyb1 and Hyb2 images8,9,10 shows a distinct peak at the center (Fig. 1b) and provides the RNA copy number even when the spots overlap and no obvious colocalization occurs between the images. We previously observed that mRNAs follow a spatial Poisson distribution5 in cells. As the variance of the Poisson distribution is equal to its mean, the peak value at the crosscorrelation is a good estimator for transcript copy number. In addition, given that the higher-order cumulants of the Poisson distribution are all equal to the mean, the higher-order crosscorrelation peaks are also good estimators for the corresponding barcode copy numbers. For simplicity, we implement only pairwise correlation for the proof-of-principle demonstrations.The corrFISH counts scale linearly with increasing density, while the localization-based method of counting FISH spots yields significant errors in estimating RNA copy number at a density of more than 1 molecule/\u03bcm2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). In simulated data, 100 A molecules in 30-\u03bcm cells were accurately measured in the presence of 10,000 B or C molecules with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 1.76 \u00b1 1.54 (s.e.m., n = 20) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, the copy number of A molecules, which comprise only 1% of total labeled RNA (at a density of more than 10 molecules/\u03bcm2), can be estimated within two-fold of the mean value.As an experimental demonstration, we used corrFISH to quantify highly abundant ribosomal protein transcripts in single cells. Mice embryos have a mosaic distribution of these transcripts in different tissue types11; thus, it would be interesting to profile their abundance at the single-cell level. Initially, we compared corrFISH with single-molecule FISH (smFISH) quantification12 in the same cell. As a proof of concept, we quantified Rps2 transcript in mammalian cell cultures in the presence of other dense transcripts using sequential hybridizations. In the first round, Rps2 was hybridized with four other genes, and in the second round, Rps2 was hybridized with a different set of four genes (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4). In the third round, we only hybridized Rps2. This allowed us to perform two controls. First, we compared the detection of Rps2 using corrFISH barcoding of Hyb1*Hyb2 to that from Hyb2*Hyb3, finding a good linear regression (R = 0.83; Fig. 1f). Next, we compared corrFISH results from Hyb1*Hyb2 to smFISH counting in Hyb3, yielding a correlation of R = 0.86 in the lower copy range (Fig. 1g). At high copy numbers (>3,000), smFISH quantification underestimates the transcript copy number because of FISH dot overlaps. These experiments show that corrFISH accurately quantifies high-copy-number genes in the presence of other high-copy-number transcripts. In fact, scaling this approach to all 79 ribosomal protein mRNAs requires similar densities of six genes per hybridization image (Supplementary Fig. 5).To further test the performance of corrFISH, we targeted transcripts for ten ribosomal proteins in two phenotypically different cell lines: mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) and mammary-gland epithelial cells (NMuMG) (Fig. 2a). We used wide-field and confocal microscopy for our binary barcoded transcript measurements (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138). To assess the dynamic range of corrFISH, we compared smFISH counting to corrFISH quantification for Rps2, Rps6, Rpl23, Rpl18a, and Rpl21 (Supplementary Fig. 9). While smFISH counting tended to underestimate the transcripts on account of the overlapping FISH spots (Fig. 2d), the integrated intensity correlated well with corrFISH with an R2 value of 0.95 (Fig. 2e). At the highest copy numbers, 5,000 smFISH counts corresponded to 15,000 corrFISH counts. These smFISH comparisons validated that corrFISH achieves reliable detection over a high dynamic range of up to 15,000 counts per cell. In our experiments, a target RNA molecule (one out of three species) with a density of 0.5\u20139 molecules/\u03bcm2 can be accurately quantified within a total density of 5\u201315 molecule/\u03bcm2 per hybridization by corrFISH within less than 10% error (Supplementary Fig. 10). To determine the sensitivity of corrFISH, we measured the number of empty barcodes detected (Fig. 2f). The negative controls in Hyb1 and Hyb2 showed negligible correlation values and provided a limit of detection (LOD) density of 0.08 molecules/\u03bcm2 (222 \u00b1 18 s.e.m. counts/average 2,674 \u03bcm2 cellular area).Figure 2: corrFISH works accurately in cultured cells.(a) Ribosomal protein transcripts imaged across four hybridizations in NIH3T3 and NMuMG cells.

Scale bars, 10 \u03bcm.\nSource data\nFull size imagecorrFISH can also provide spatial maps of gene expression profiles. Subcellular details can be resolved by performing correlation analysis on subregions within cells (Supplementary Fig. 11). We profiled transcript distribution in 25 subcellular regions for Rpl3 and Rpl27a mRNAs (Fig. 2g). In most fibroblast cells, ribosomal protein transcripts were detected outside the nuclear region (circled) in the subregion correlation analysis. Varying subregion window size did not significantly affect the results (Supplementary Fig. 12).When RNAs are not Poisson distributed across the cell or sample, corrFISH needs to be used with subregion analysis. A heterogeneous image can be subdivided into regions of relatively homogenous, Poisson-distributed mRNAs, which are analyzed separately and summed (Supplementary Fig. 13). We successfully implemented spatial analysis in tissue sections at single-cell resolution. However, corrFISH quantitation can break down if RNA granules containing multiple RNAs exist within a diffraction-limited region. These problematic regions can be cropped out of the image and removed from correlation analysis if they occur.We quantified gene expression of ten ribosomal proteins with corrFISH in 10-\u03bcm-thick thymus tissue sections (Fig. 3). The thymus is of particular interest because ribosome function has recently been shown to play important roles in hematopoiesis13 and the immune system14. To barcode the ten transcripts, we performed six hybridizations with a single color (Fig. 3b). The transcript distributions for these ribosomal protein genes are heterogeneous (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 14). Repeat barcodes plotted against their counterparts gave a linear correlation (R = 0.9) for 162 thymus cells (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicating accurate quantitation in tissues.Figure 3: corrFISH reveals cell-specific ribosomal protein gene expression in tissue sections.(a) CorrFISH was applied to mouse thymus sections over six hybridizations using only Cy3b-labeled probes.

(d) Mapping of the cell clusters in the thymus section at three different locations showed heterogeneous distribution and layering of cell types. Scale bars, 5 \u03bcm.\nSource data\nFull size imageTo evaluate molecular differences in phenotypically distinct cells, we performed hierarchical clustering of gene expression in 80 NMuMG, 85 NIH3T3, and 162 thymus cells. These results exhibited unique clusters for all three cell types (Fig. 3c). The ability to define cell types based on ribosomal protein composition supports the specialized ribosome theory15. The NIH3T3 and NMuMG gene expression profiles showed significant variability across single cells and most genes exhibited a unimodal distribution (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17). Rps2 had the highest expression level (mean 9,800 copies per cell in NIH3T3 and 5,000 copies per cell in NMuMG), while Rpl21 and Rpl18a had the lowest expression level (respective means of 975 and 1,284 copies per cell in NIH3T3; 981 and 1,400 copies per cell in NMuMG). We observed combinatorial gene expression patterns for each cell type (Fig. 3c). For example, Rps2 (high-copy regulator) and Rpl21 (low-copy regulator) were relatively uniformly expressed across all cells, while other genes were expressed in a combinatorial set of patterns in different cell types.To ask whether thymus has spatial patterns of cell types with distinct gene expression profiles, we mapped the transcriptional profiles back to single cells on the tissue images. Unique spatial patterning of six different thymus cell subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, and F) were obtained on three distinct regions of the same thymus section (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 18). Cellular interactions in the thymus play an important role in immune cell repertoire formation, and studies of these interactions may be informed by our observation of the spatial organization of cellular subtypes.To cover a large dynamic range, high-copy-number transcripts can be barcoded and analyzed by corrFISH first. Then the probes can be stripped, and a second barcoding experiment in the same sample can be performed on low-abundance transcripts using localization. This hybrid approach allows low-abundance genes to be accurately detected with single-molecule resolution and high-copy-number genes to be profiled in the same cell.corrFISH demonstrates that RNA quantification does not need to rely on smFISH spot resolution, removing the constraints on seqFISH to allow the targeting of RNAs with much higher expression levels without the need for super-resolution microscopy. Conceptually, this is similar to the ability of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)16 to quantify molecular concentration down to the single-molecule level even in high-concentration solutions. In our case, the temporal dimension is generated by sequential rounds of hybridization rather than real time. In principle, this image correlation approach can be applied to decode high-density images to multiplex molecular species other than RNA, including proteins17,18,19,20 and metabolites21.MethodsTheory.For quantification of transcripts, we used correlation analyses on a series of seqFISH images. We performed a pairwise correlation from the subset of hybridization images for quantitation of each gene. For instance, we used equation (1) to compute crosscorrelation in between Hyb1 and Hyb2 images8,9,10 (see Supplementary Note for derivation).where G12 is the crosscorrelation of the images from hyb1 and hyb2, \u22121 is the inverse Fourier Transform and  is for the Fourier Transform operations. H1 and H2 are the images, and \u3008H1\u3009 and \u3008H2\u3009 are the mean values of the corresponding images (brackets are expected values).These correlation results were then converted to the transcript abundance by using equations (2) and (3). The amplitude of crosscorrelation was normalized by the autocorrelation amplitudes as an estimator of RNA copy number in a cell-per-point spread function (PSF) area.where \u3008d12\u3009 is the abundance of transcripts in an PSF area that are common across hybridizations 1 and 2 (brackets are expected values), G12 is the amplitude of the crosscorrelations peak between the Hyb1 and Hyb2 images, and G11 and G22 are the autocorrelation peak amplitudes of Hyb1 and Hyb2, respectively. Transcript count per PSF area was then converted to the total number of transcripts for a single cell:where \u3008N12\u3009 is the number of transcripts that are common across hybridizations 1 and 2. Here, \u3008d12\u3009 is the copy number of transcripts per PSF area from equation (2). APSF is the PSF area (\u03c0 \u00d7 PSFwidth2), where PSFwidth is about 0.3 \u03bcm. ACell is the area of the single-cell image (N \u00d7 p2), where N is the total number of pixels in a cell and p is the pixel size of 0.13 \u03bcm in our corrFISH analysis.Simulations.We used digital data to imitate the realistic FISH experiments at various densities and conditions. Using a custom-written MATLAB algorithm, point emitters were randomly distributed in a digital image of size 230 \u00d7 230 pixels (corresponding to 30 \u03bcm \u00d7 30 \u03bcm cell area). Emitters were convolved with 0.3 \u03bcm width point-spread function (PSF) corresponding to a 100\u00d7 wide-field fluorescence microscope (0.13 \u03bcm pixel size), matching the cell sizes and pixel resolution in the FISH experiments. The obtained images mimic the molecules labeled with fluorescent dyes. Adjusting the total number of emitters per simulation area changed concentration of the molecules. Sequences of these images were correlated in spatial or Fourier domains to compute the abundances of molecules that are common across these image arrays (Supplementary Note). In addition, we performed super-resolution microscopy simulations with 0.05 \u03bcm pixel size to show that correlation decoding can even achieve higher-density multiplexing (Supplementary Fig. 19).Cultures.NIH3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with GlutaMAX, high glucose, and pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, 10569), bovine calf serum (10%), and penicillin\u2013streptomycin (PenStrep) media and passaged every few days. Cells were plated on 24 \u00d7 50 mm fibronectin coated slides overnight within culture media in a petri dish. After 15 h, glass slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1\u00d7 and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 4 min. Cells were then placed in 70% ethanol for permeabilization and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. NMuMg cells (ATCC CRL-1636) were cultured in DMEM with glutamine and 4.5 g/L glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, 11965), fetal bovine serum (10%), insulin (10 mcg/ml), and PenStrep media. The rest of the fixation and permeabilization protocols was the same. For experiments, glass slides with either cell type were removed from \u221220 \u00b0C storage and then dried with air blow. A custom flow-cell chamber (Grace Bio-Labs, SecureSeal, 3 mm \u00d7 11 mm size \u00d7 0.5 mm depth, RD478682) was then bound to this glass slide for sequential FISH measurements.Tissue.Intact thymus was extracted from a four-week-old female mouse. Animal handling was done in Rothenberg's laboratory with approval by Caltech's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Immediately after extraction, thymus was embedded into 4% paraformaldehyde for three hours at room temperature for fixation of cells within the organ. Thymus was then rinsed with PBS1\u00d7 for 10 min. For slicing, thymus was then embedded in 10% sucrose and kept at 4 \u00b0C for more than 12 h. Saline coated glass slides (24 mm \u00d7 50 mm) were then used to host 10 \u03bcm tissue sections after cutting at the City of Hope Pathology Core. Thymus tissue sections were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C deep freezer for storage. The day before the FISH experiment, tissue section was removed from the freezer and thawed at room temperature for one hour. To clear the section and reduce nonspecific binding, tissue was first treated with 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 10 min. Tissue section was then treated with 70% ethanol overnight at 4 \u00b0C for permeabilization. The next day, the glass slide with tissue section was then bound to the hybridization flow chamber (Grace Bio-Labs, SecureSeal, 8\u20139 mm diameter \u00d7 0.6 mm depth, GBL621101) for sequential labeling and imaging experiments.SeqFISH.24 FISH probes were used for each gene. Cy3B, Alexa 594, and Alexa 647 were coupled to the probes according to the barcode scheme. Cells or tissue sections within flow chambers were hybridized at a concentration of 1 nM per probe overnight in a hybridization buffer of 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma D8906), 30% formamide, 2\u00d7 saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer at room temperature. Labeled cells were then washed with 30% formamide for 30 min. For tissues, cells were washed a second time with 50% formamide for 10 min. Samples were rinsed several times with 2\u00d7 SSC to remove leftover probes. Samples were then imaged within an antibleaching buffer consisting of Tris-HCL (20 mM), NaCl (50 mM), glucose (0.8%), saturated Trolox (Sigma, 53188-07-1), pyranose oxidase (Sigma: P4234, OD405 nm: 0.05), and catalase (Sigma, 9001-05-2, 1:1000 dilution). A piece of glass slide or parafilm was used to cover the top facet of the flow cell, preventing the imaging or hybridization buffer from evaporation. After imaging the samples, FISH probes were removed by 100 units of DNase I enzymatic treatment (Sigma-Aldrich, 04716728001 ROCHE) for 4 h followed by a postwash with 30% formamide and 2\u00d7 SSC wash for 10 min. The cells were subsequently hybridized by another probe set at 1 nM concentration for more than 12 h at room temperate in the hybridization buffer. These presented imaging, probe stripping, and hybridization protocols are repeated based on the barcoding scheme1.Barcoding.In cultures, we targeted transcripts for ten ribosomal proteins with corrFISH with two color binary codes (Fig. 2b). We barcoded five of the ribosomal protein genes (Rpl5, Rps6, Rpl21, Rps3, and Rps7) by sequential hybridizations of probes labeled by Alexa 594 fluorophores, and then we coded the second set of genes (Rps2, Rpl3, Rpl27a, Rpl23, and Rpl18a) by Alexa 647 probes. This implementation of corrFISH keeps the barcoding within each fluorophore channel to avoid errors introduced by chromatic aberration and spectral crosstalk. For validation of corrFISH, we used an additional color (in this case Cy3b) for single-molecule FISH experiments to validate the corrFISH results (Fig. 2b). In tissues, we barcoded transcripts for ten ribosomal proteins with a single binary code (Cy3b), in which additional four repeats for Rps2, Rps6, Rpl21, and Rps3 as a positive control, and 1 empty barcode as a negative control are included in the barcoding scheme (Fig. 3b). Adding more colors and correlation dimensions to the barcoding scheme linearly increased the number of target RNA species for corrFISH (Supplementary Fig. 5). Incorporating chromatic corrections can further scale up the multiplexing capacity to the exponential rate seen in the seqFISH method1.Imaging.Cell cultures were imaged by a custom wide-field fluorescence microscope with single-molecule imaging capability (Supplementary Fig. 20). A simple fiber combiner (CNI Laser, 7 pieces to 1 piece connect with ferrule connector (FC) end or, alternatively, Oz Optics, 1 \u00d7 6 pigtail wavelength division multiplexer) was used to merge laser beams creating a single output beam for illumination. Each illumination laser was fiber coupled and had about 1 W power with 405, 473, 533, 589, 640, and 730 nm center wavelengths (CNI Lasers). This fiber-based design removed the free space optics alignment requirement for multicolor illumination of cells. Fiber output (>100 mW) was then collimated with a simple convex lens and got vibrated by a custom fiber shaker all the time to avoid speckle issues. To enlarge the beam, a 1.5\u00d7 telescope (f1: 200 mm and f2: 300 mm) was inserted after collimation lens. Expanded illumination was then focused at the back aperture of the objective lens using another 200 mm convex lens. All of these lenses (Thorlabs) were 2\u2033 diameter to reduce aberrations. 60\u00d7 objective (1.42 numerical aperture) lens was used to collect fluorescence from the cells. We obtained 96\u00d7 magnification with the use of 1.6\u00d7 tube lens magnification providing 0.135 \u03bcm pixel size. High-quantum-efficiency Andor Ikon M camera was used to record the fluorescence from single molecules. We used up to 500 ms exposure time per color channel to capture FISH images. All the devices were controlled by Micromanager.Tissue sections were imaged by a spinning disk confocal microscope (Andor, WD model). In our experiments, 561 nm laser illumination was used to image Cy3b-labeled probes and 405 nm laser was used to capture DAPI signal. 100\u00d7 objective lens was used to collect the fluorescence. We tuned into relatively higher exposure time of up to 20 s per FISH image to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio FISH dots. A Metamorph software was used to control the devices and capture images. Compared to the point confocal imaging, spinning disk allowed us to reduce the photobleaching of our single molecules and increased imaging speed.Analysis.Sequential FISH images were processed in MATLAB using a digital image-processing pipeline. Raw single-molecule images were segmented to create a mask to cover the entire cell. Cell autofluorescence background was subtracted by using the image of the cell without FISH probes. Cell background image was registered to the original cell image with FISH probes to improve the subtraction quality. To remove the out-of-focus light, background subtracted images were deconvolved using a Lucy\u2013Richardson iterative algorithm. The binary mask was then multiplied by deconvolved cell images from sequential hybridizations to define the cell areas. corrFISH was then processed z by z plane on the cell images. These transcript counts were then combined by summing the results from each section (Supplementary Fig. 8). Here, two subsequent planes were summed to increase the robustness of corrFISH processing. The final single-cell transcript counts were then plotted as a heat map, violin plot, and hierarchical cluster of gene expression. Additional control experiments with various experimental conditions were analyzed by box plots (Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22).Single-molecule FISH counting was performed based on a localization and counting algorithm12. Specifically, a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter was applied to the background subtracted and deconvolved images (Supplementary Note). Individual transcripts were then identified and counted z by z plane. These counts were then summed to compute the gene expression in single cells. As the density of molecules increased, the FISH dots overlapped, creating underestimation for most of the ribosomal protein transcripts.For spatial analysis in cultured cells, repeat hybridizations, both containing Rpl3 and Rpl27a, are correlated to generate the map (Fig. 2g).Tissue analysis was performed by segmenting the cells based on their DAPI image and propagating to subsequent hybridizations. We processed 16 pixel by 16 pixel subregions and the subregions within a cell mask were correlated individually. Then the correlation values were summed together to provide the gene expression value for that cell (Supplementary Fig. 13).For statistical analysis, we used Origin and Excel programs with regression and Student's t-test modules.Code availability.Custom MATLAB source codes (Supplementary Software) with test images are available and updated at https://github.com/singlecelllab/correlationFISH.\n\n\nReferencesLubeck, E., Coskun, A.F., Zhiyentayev, T., Ahmad, M. & Cai, L.

In particular, the invention disclosed herein relates to the design and characteristics of such defined regions and methods and systems for creating or triggering molecular changes that lead to or result from certain random or specific molecular events such as signal transduction. Further, the invention disclosed herein relates to methods and systems for capturing, characterizing and analyzing the molecular changes, in order to extrapolate lineage or phylogenetic information connecting such molecular events or record the history of cellular events.\n BACKGROUND\n \n    \n    [0003]\n   A fundamental problem throughout developmental biology is determining the lineages through which cells differentiate to form tissues and organs. Lineage information is critical for addressing basic developmental questions in diverse systems including the brain and tumor genesis. Although the lineage map of embryonic development in C. elegans was worked out three decades ago (1), systematic techniques that can produce such comprehensive maps in more complex organisms are lacking. Furthermore, in order to understand how lineages are determined, the lineage tree needs to be connected directly to the molecular changes and eventually molecular events that occur in cells to determine developmental decisions.\n  \n    \n    [0004]\n   Existing lineage determination approaches have severe limitations. Most current approaches are based on marking the descendants of selected cells (2, 3). Site-specific recombinases such as FLP and Cre can be used to mark the descendants of particular cells (4-6). More sophisticated variants, such as Brainbow (7), can mark many distinct cells at one time to follow their descendants. However, these techniques do not allow one to follow multiple lineage decisions or reconstruct an entire tree in a single experiment. Finally, no existing technique enables one to systematically record the molecular events that occur during lineage determination within the cells themselves.\n  \n    \n    [0005]\n   What is needed in the art are vastly improved tools for tracking lineage information, capturing molecular changes during development and reading out this information with minimal perturbations to cells and organisms, ideally within the cells themselves.\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n \n    \n    [0006]\n   In one aspect, provided herein is a method for characterizing lineage information or recording molecular events among cells in a cell population. The method comprises the steps of: introducing, over a time period of multiple cell cycle generations, a plurality of molecular changes in at least one of one or more genetic scratchpads in one or more cells in a cell population, characterizing, at one or more time points during the time period, a status of molecular changes at each time for the plurality of target sites in each genetic scratchpad in cells in the cell population, wherein the cells are essentially intact or undisrupted, wherein at least one time point in the one or more time points is two or more cell cycle generations from the beginning of the time period; and establishing lineage connections between cells from different cell cycle generations by comparing statuses of molecular changes of the cells.\n  \n    \n    [0007]\n   In some embodiments, the cell population comprises cells that have developed for one or more cell cycle generations.

In some embodiments, the nuclease is Cas9 nuclease\n  \n    \n    [0015]\n   In some embodiments, the multiple time points during the time period cover two or more cell cycle generations. In some embodiments, the multiple time points during the time period cover three or more cell cycle generations. In some embodiments, the multiple time points during the time period cover five or more cell cycle generations.\n  \n    \n    [0016]\n   In some embodiments, the plurality of molecular changes comprises a plurality of mutations. In some embodiments, the plurality of mutations comprises one selected from the group consisting of an insertion mutation, a deletion mutation, a point mutation, multiple points mutations, and combinations thereof.\n  \n    \n    [0017]\n   In some embodiments, each target site further comprises a barcode sequence linked to the guide sequence.\n  \n    \n    [0018]\n   In some embodiments, the barcode sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence having a length between about 400 nucleic acids to about 2,000 nucleic acids. In some embodiments, the barcode sequence nucleic acids a nucleotide sequence having a length between about 50 nucleic acids to about 200 nucleic acids.\n  \n    \n    [0019]\n   In some embodiments, each target site in a plurality of target sites within at least one genetic scratchpad comprises the same guide sequence that is recognized by a unique guide molecule.\n  \n    \n    [0020]\n   In some embodiments, each target site in a plurality of target sites within at least one genetic scratchpad comprises a different guide sequence that is recognized by a unique and different guide molecule.\n  \n    \n    [0021]\n   In some embodiments, the plurality of target sites within at least one genetic scratchpad comprises one selected from the group consisting of two or more different guide sequences, three or more different guide sequences, five or more different guide sequences, eight or more different guide sequences, 10 or more different guide sequences, 15 or more different guide sequences, 20 or more different guide sequences, and 30 or more different guide sequences.\n  \n    \n    [0022]\n   In some embodiments, the characterizing step further comprises the steps of: applying a set of probes to cells in the cell population and characterizing a mutation status at the plurality of target sites based on the absence and presence of signals.\n  \n    \n    [0023]\n   In some embodiments, each probe comprises a nucleic acid sequence designed to bind to a target site within the plurality of target site. In some embodiments, each probe is associated with a label that produces a signal upon binding between the probe and its corresponding target site.\n  \n    \n    [0024]\n   In some embodiments, absence of a signal indicates a mutation at the target site and the presence of a signal indicates an intact target site, or vice versa\n  \n    \n    [0025]\n   In some embodiments, the set of probes comprises RNA probes or DNA probes. In some embodiments, probes in the set of probes are associated with multiple labels that produce different signals.\n  \n    \n    [0026]\n   In some embodiments, each probes of the set of probes are designed to bind to a guide sequence within a target site within the plurality of target site.\n  \n    \n    [0027]\n   In some embodiments, each probes of the set of probes are designed to further bind to a barcode sequence linked to the guide sequence within a target site within the plurality of target site.\n  \n    \n    [0028]\n   In one aspect, provided herein is a system for characterizing lineage information or recording molecular events among cells in a cell population. The system comprises a few component, including for example, a housing component, a characterization component and an analytical component.\n  \n    \n    [0029]\n   In some embodiments, the housing component provides housing for one or more cells in a cell population. A plurality of molecular changes is introduced over a time period of multiple cell cycle generations in at least one of one or more genetic scratchpads in one or more cells in a cell population. In some embodiments, the cell population comprises cells that have developed for one or more cell cycle generations. In some embodiments, each genetic scratchpad in the one or more genetic scratchpads comprises a polynucleotide sequence and a plurality of target sites within the polynucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of molecular changes is associated with a target site among the plurality of target sites.\n  \n    \n    [0030]\n   In some embodiments, the characterization component is configured to characterize the cell population. At one or more time points during the time period, a status of molecular changes at each time for the plurality of target sites in each genetic scratchpad in cells in the cell population is characterized, for example, by fluorescence imaging techniques using probes that recognize mutations with target sites in genetic scratchpads in cells in the cell population. In some embodiments, the molecular changes represent one or more molecular events: they are either the cause or result of one or more molecular events.\n  \n    \n    [0031]\n   In some embodiments, the cells are essentially intact or undisrupted, wherein at least one time point in the one or more time points is two or more cell cycle generations from the beginning of the time period.\n  \n    \n    [0032]\n   In some embodiments, the analytical component is designed to receive data from the characterization component.

For example, a cell within the meaning of this term can include a cell that is made at least partially permeable such that external buffer and reagents can be introduced into the cell. Such external reagents include but are not limited to probes, labels, labeled probes, and/or combinations thereof.\n  \n    \n    [0072]\n   As used herein, the term \u201cgenetic scratchpad\u201d refers to a polynucleotide sequence within a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. In some embodiments, the genetic scratchpad can be synthesized in vitro and then put into the cell. In some embodiments, the genetic scratchpad refers to a defined location within the natural genomic sequence of the cell. In some embodiments, the genetic scratchpad can refer to a defined location within the natural genomic sequence of the cell that has been modified. Within the polynucleotide sequence of a genetic scratchpad, there are multiple target sites. In some embodiments, each target site comprises a guide sequence that can be recognized by a unique guide molecule.\n  \n    \n    [0073]\n   As use herein, the term \u201cmolecular event\u201d refers to occurrences that happen in a cell and that we can record with our method, like a signaling event, transcription factor activity or even a more complex process such as tumor genesis or kinase transduction pathway. The term \u201cmolecular change\u201d or \u201cmolecular alteration or mutation\u201d refers to a change that occurs in the scratchpad, like a genetic mutation or genetic modification. The molecular change can be the result or the cause of a molecular event.\n  \n    \n    [0074]\n   As used herein, the term \u201cmutation\u201d or \u201cgenetic mutation\u201d refers to any recognizable variation in nucleotide sequence that can be used in accordance with the present invention. For example, a mutation can be a deletion or an insertion of a polynucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, the absence or presence of the polynucleotide sequence can be indicated by using one or more visible indicia; for example, a nucleotide hybridization probe with a fluorescent color label. The length of the polynucleotide deletion or insertion can vary with applications and sensitivities of the probes. For example, the polynucleotide comprises 10 or fewer nucleic acids, 20 or fewer nucleic acids, 30 or fewer nucleic acids, 40 or fewer nucleic acids, 50 or fewer nucleic acids, 60 or fewer nucleic acids, 70 or fewer nucleic acids, 80 or fewer nucleic acids, 90 or fewer nucleic acids, 100 or fewer nucleic acids, 150 or fewer nucleic acids, 200 or fewer nucleic acids, 250 or fewer nucleic acids, 300 or fewer nucleic acids, 350 or fewer nucleic acids, 400 or fewer nucleic acids, 450 or fewer nucleic acids, 500 or fewer nucleic acids, 600 or fewer nucleic acids, 700 or fewer nucleic acids, 800 or fewer nucleic acids, 900 or fewer nucleic acids, 1,000 or fewer nucleic acids, 1,500 or fewer nucleotides, 2,000 or fewer nucleic acids, 5,000 or fewer nucleic acids, or 10,000 or fewer nucleic acids.

This guide molecule may be a guide RNA (gRNA), which recruits a second molecule such as nuclease to the binding site to create mutations. In some embodiments, a guide sequence comprises 10 or fewer nucleic acids, 20 or fewer nucleic acids, 30 or fewer nucleic acids, 40 or fewer nucleic acids, 50 or fewer nucleic acids, 60 or fewer nucleic acids, 70 or fewer nucleic acids, 80 or fewer nucleic acids, 90 or fewer nucleic acids, 100 or fewer nucleic acids, 150 or fewer nucleic acids, or 250 or fewer nucleic acids. In some embodiments, the guide sequence comprises 500 or more nucleic acids or even 1,000 nucleic acids when tandem gRNAs are implemented in a target site.\n  \n    \n    [0076]\n   As used herein, the term \u201cbarcode\u201d refers to a sequence within a target site that can be used to identify the particular target site. A barcode sequence is also referred to as a target sequence. In some embodiments, a barcode sequence is linked to a corresponding guide sequence.

In some embodiments, a barcode sequence comprises more than 5,000 nucleic acids.\n  \n    \n    [0077]\n   As used herein, the term \u201cprobe\u201d refers to any composition that can be specifically associated with a target nucleotide within a cell. A probe can be a small molecular or a large molecule. Exemplary probes include but are not limited to nucleic acids such as oligos. In some embodiments, a probe is associated with a visible label such as a fluorescence label to indicate the presence of a certain nucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, the probe can be a DNA probe or an RNA probe. In some embodiments, a probe sequence comprises 10 or fewer nucleic acids, 20 or fewer nucleic acids, 30 or fewer nucleic acids, 40 or fewer nucleic acids, 50 or fewer nucleic acids, 60 or fewer nucleic acids, 70 or fewer nucleic acids, 80 or fewer nucleic acids, 90 or fewer nucleic acids, 100 or fewer nucleic acids, 150 or fewer nucleic acids, 250 or fewer nucleic acids, or 500 or fewer nucleic acid. In some embodiments, a probe comprises more than 500 nucleic acids.\n  \n    \n    [0078]\n   As used herein, the term \u201clabel\u201d refers to any composition that can be used to generate the signals that constitute an indicium. The signals generated by a label can be of any form that can be resolved subsequently to constitute the indicium. Preferably, the signal is a light within the visible range. However, it will be understood by one of skill in the art that equipment and devices are available for recording and monitoring light of any wavelength. The label can also constitute any moiety, such as a hapten, that can be recognized by an antibody. This secondary antibody can be conjugated to a fluorescent molecule or an enzyme that can produce signals that constitute an indicium.\n  \n    \n    [0079]\n   Disclosed herein are methods and systems for capturing molecular events within cells to extrapolate lineage information between cells from different generations. An exemplary system includes one or more of the following components: one or more genetic scratchpad(s) where molecular changes such as genetic mutations or modification will occur; a writing component for creating the genetic mutations within the genetic scratchpad; a characterization component for capturing the mutation status of a genetic scratchpad by identifying the presence and absence of such genetic mutations; and an analysis component for reading out mutations that have been created in the scratchpads.\n  \n    \n    [0080]\n    FIG. 1 outlines an exemplary process disclosed herein.\n  \n    \n    [0081]\n   At step 110, one or more genetic scratchpads are specified with a cell. As noted above, molecular changes as disclosed herein (e.g., genetic mutations or modification) take place within the genetic scratchpads. More precisely, a genetic scratch comprises one or more target sites and the molecular changes take place at the target sites. One of skill in the art will understand that similar molecular changes also occur elsewhere inside the cells. However, those events are not within the scope of subsequent analysis. In addition, after the molecular changes have taken place, subsequent analysis (such as visualization of the presence and absence of genetic mutations) will also be focused on the genetic scratchpad, for example at the target sites. As disclosed herein, the terms \u201cgenetic scratchpad,\u201d \u201cscratchpad\u201d and variations thereof are used interchangeably.\n  \n    \n    [0082]\n   As disclosed herein, a genetic scratchpad comprises nucleotide sequences that are synthesized in vitro. Alternatively, a genetic scratchpad comprises a natural region of the genomic sequence of the cell. Still alternatively, a genetic scratchpad comprises a hybrid of synthetic and natural sequences. Still alternatively, a genetic scratchpad comprises natural nucleotide sequence that has been modified at one or more locations.\n  \n    \n    [0083]\n   At step 120, molecular changes such as genetic mutations are introduced into one or more genetic scratchpads over a time period that spans multiple cell cycle generations. Such molecular changes can be genetic mutations such as insertions or deletions of nucleotide sequences at one or more of the target sites within a genetic scratchpad. Alternatively, the molecular changes can be genetic modifications. For example, a DNA segment can be methylated to alternative its functionality or possibility of be transcribed. In particular, a methyl-transferase can be fused to cas9 and target specific sites to bring about changes in a target site in one or more genetic scratchpads.\n  \n    \n    [0084]\n   At any given cell cycle, the same molecular changes can be introduced into multiple genetic scratchpads or multiple target sites within the same scratchpad. In some embodiments, no molecular changes take place in any genetic scratchpad during a particular cell cycle.\n  \n    \n    [0085]\n   At step 130, the genetic status of the genetic scratchpads (e.g., the status of target sites within the scratchpads) within cells from step 120 is characterized. Characterization of genetic status includes identifying the presence and absence of genetic mutations at target sites within one or more scratchpads.\n  \n    \n    [0086]\n   In some embodiments, labeled probes designed to bind specific sequences in the target sites are used. For example, an intact target site (e.g., no molecular change has taken place at the site) will allow proper binding between the labelled probes and the target site. Upon binding, the label can be induced to emit signals such as fluorescent light. In contrast, if a target site is disrupted by a molecular change, for example, due to deletion or insert of nucleotide sequences, a probe specifically targeting the site will no longer be able to bind. Consequently, there will be no label attached to the target site and no subsequent fluorescent signals. In exemplary embodiments, the presence of fluorescent signal at a target site suggests that no molecular changes have occurred while absence of such a signal at a target site suggests that one or more molecular changes have occurred to disrupt the sequence at the target site. In alternate embodiments, the induced mutation could result in the emergence of a new, detectable fluorescence signal. For example, in the absence of a mutation, fluorescent probes might not bind the target site. After a particular mutation, such as an insertion mutation, probes will be able to bind the site and produce a detectable signal.\n  \n    \n    [0087]\n   Over multiple cell cycles, a cell (e.g., an ancestor cell) at the beginning of the time period has divided into multiple progeny cells. As such, at a given time point, there are progeny cells present that carry information about their past and ancestry. As disclosed herein, characterization of genetic status is carried out for cells in the cell population at a defined time point. Genetic status characterization of cells within the population allows construction of their lineage relationships as well as a record of any other historical events being tracked. The characterization time point is selected to provide information across the time window of interest, which ideally spans multiple cell cycle generations to allow reconstruction of a comprehensive history.\n  \n    \n    [0088]\n   Alternatively, characterization can also be carried out at multiple, distinct time points. The time points can be chosen as desired to focus on changes across cell generations of interest. In some embodiments, this can be helpful in order to effectively sample changes across long processes and/or focus on multiple subsets of events within these processes: for example, for extracting lineage information and cellular histories during stereotypic, developmental processes, where defined cell types emerge at distinct times.\n  \n    \n    [0089]\n   In some embodiments, presence and absence of fluorescent signals are determined by comparing images of both ancestor and progeny cells.\n  \n    \n    [0090]\n   Here, the genetic status of a given cell is assessed while the structural and functional integrity within the cell is maintained. Additionally minimal perturbations are made to the spatial proximity of the cells within the population.\n  \n    \n    [0091]\n   At step 140, the genetic status data captured at step 130 is subject to further analysis. In particular, the mutation status of an ancestor cell and its progeny cells at different cell cycle generations are identified and compared to extrapolate lineage and phylogenetic information and/or cellular event history.\n  \n    \n    [0092]\n   In one aspect, the method and system disclosed herein are capable of capturing or recording multiple molecular changes over time; it is not limited to registering a single change.\n  \n    \n    [0093]\n   To this end, in some embodiments, multiple \u201cscratchpads\u201d are specified in the cell genome. A genetic scratchpad can be any polynucleotide sequence whose sequence information is at least partially known. A scratchpad can be \u201cwritten on\u201d and serves as a unique recording or capturing site.\n  \n    \n    [0094]\n   Scratchpads can be synthetic and composed of a variety of elements including repetitive segments, homology regions flanking a central core comprising the repetitive segments and one or more promoter sequences, and enzymatic recognition sequences. Scratchpad units may be a range of lengths and include various upstream promoters or other elements and different downstream sequences. They can be introduced into the genome as separate units or as part of a larger integrated cassette, like an artificial chromosome. Alternatively, scratchpads can also utilize the endogenous genomic DNA and not require synthetic additions.\n  \n    \n    [0095]\n   In some embodiments, a genetic scratchpad comprises nucleotide sequences that are synthesized in vitro and then introduced into cells by methods such as transfection.\n  \n    \n    [0096]\n    FIG. 2A depicts an exemplary embodiment, illustrating the basic scratchpad configuration, from left to right, which includes a 5 prime inverted repeat for integration (thin rectangle), an insulated promoter region (rectangular box with an arrow), a repetitive region flanked by enzymatic recognition sequences (thin arrowheads), and 3 prime inverted repeat (thin rectangle).\n  \n    \n    [0097]\n   In some embodiments, an implementation of this strategy involves a scratchpad with a repetitive sequence at its core that can be deleted (FIG. 2A); for example, by enzyme that can recognize the recognition sequences that flank the repetitive sequences. In some embodiments, the scratchpad has multiple target sites and the repetitive sequences are inserted at different target sites in the scratchpad. In some embodiments, such repetitive sequences are inserted into multiple scratchpads.\n  \n    \n    [0098]\n   In some embodiments, an implementation of this strategy involves a scratchpad with a repetitive sequence at its core that can be deleted (FIG. 2A). In such embodiments, a genetic scratchpad comprises one or more target sites with such a repetitive sequence. In some embodiments, these target sites comprise different number of copies of such a repetitive sequences. For example, scratchpad A has 5 target sites. Target site 1 has 3 copies of the repetitive sequences while target site 2 can have 5 or more copies of the same repetitive sequences and etc. Because the repetitive sequences are between enzyme cleavage sites, by altering the number of repetitive sequences, different target sites can be identified by using methods that can assess the length of the resulting genetic scratchpad. An exemplary method includes single cell based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.\n  \n    \n    [0099]\n   In some embodiments, though the core of the scratchpad is the same in each case, the sites can actually be differentiated because they are flanked by distinct genomic regions. The genomic context of each scratchpad can be identified individually by PCR and/or next generation sequencing methods, providing a unique target sequence or \u201cbarcode\u201d for each scratchpad. For example, one characterized line has at least 10 scratchpads spread across unique genomic regions on 7 chromosomes. Unique target sequence or barcodes can also be created by other means, including constructing scratchpads with different unique synthetic sequences.\n  \n    \n    [0100]\n   In some embodiments, multiple copies of this scratchpad can be introduced throughout the genome by transposase mediated recognition of inverted repeats (FIG. 2A), or other means, creating a large number of unique target sites. Molecular changes at these target sites will be captured or recorded.\n  \n    \n    [0101]\n   In some embodiments, the scratchpad can contain other features, such as a promoter that allows transcription of this scratchpad and helps with readout (a feature described further below).\n  \n    \n    [0102]\n   In alterative embodiments, a genetic scratchpad is located in defined regions within the natural genome of a cell. Because the sequence information of the genome of many organisms, including humans, is known, a genetic scratchpad can be defined based on the sequence information of selected genetic regions of interest in a genome. For example, sequences near or at genetic regions of interest (e.g., a target site) can be designated as a guide sequence to recruit one or more secondary molecules (e.g., a guide RNA known as a gRNA and a nuclease that is recruited by the gRNA), which facilitate the occurrence of certain molecular changes at the genetic regions of interest. In some embodiments, a nick or a double stranded break is created by the one or more secondary molecules resulting in disruption of the genetic region of interest, which can then be detected by the characterization component.\n  \n    \n    [0103]\n   In still alternative embodiments, synthetic guide sequences can be inserted into selected regions within the natural genome of a cell. In some embodiments, such guide sequences are located at or near regions of interest such as target sites. As disclosed herein above, the guide sequences can recruit one or more secondary molecules (e.g., a guide RNA known as a gRNA and a nuclease that is recruited by the gRNA), which facilitate the occurrence of certain molecular changes at the genetic region of interest.\n  \n    \n    [0104]\n   As disclosed herein, a cell can have one or more genetic scratchpads. In some embodiments, a cell has two or more genetic scratchpads, such as between three and five genetic scratchpads. In some embodiments, a cell has five or more genetic scratchpads, such as between five and nine genetic scratchpads. In some embodiments, a cell has 10 or more genetic scratchpads, such as between 10 and 15 genetic scratchpads. In some embodiments, a cell has 15 or more genetic scratchpads, such as between 15 and 19 genetic scratchpads. In some embodiments, a cell has 20 or more genetic scratchpads, 25 or more genetic scratchpads, 30 or more genetic scratchpads, 40 or more genetic scratchpads, 50 or more genetic scratchpads, 60 or more genetic scratchpads, 70 or more genetic scratchpads, 80 or more genetic scratchpads, 90 or more genetic scratchpads, 100 or more genetic scratchpads, 120 or more genetic scratchpads, 150 or more genetic scratchpads, 180 or more genetic scratchpads, 200 or more genetic scratchpads, or 500 or more genetic scratchpads.\n  \n    \n    [0105]\n   In some embodiments, the number of genetic scratchpads in a particular genomic is determined by the complexity of the lineage information. For example, the number of genetic scratchpads required for assessing the lineage information cross 10 possible regions of interest will be larger than that required for assessing the lineage information cross 3 or 5 possible regions of interest.\n  \n    \n    [0106]\n   In some embodiments, the entire sequence information of the genetic scratchpad is known. In some embodiments, only a part of the sequence information of the genetic scratchpad is known.\n  \n    \n    [0107]\n   Also as disclosed, a genetic scratchpad comprises a polynucleotide sequence of any length. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises 100 nucleotides or longer; 200 nucleotides or longer; 300 nucleotides or longer; 400 nucleotides or longer; 500 nucleotides or longer; 700 nucleotides or longer; 1,000 nucleotides or longer; 1,500 nucleotides or longer; 2,000 nucleotides or longer; 2,500 nucleotides or longer; 3,000 nucleotides or longer; 4,000 nucleotides or longer; 5,000 nucleotides or longer; 6,000 nucleotides or longer; 7,000 nucleotides or longer; 8,000 nucleotides or longer; 10,000 nucleotides or longer; 12,000 nucleotides or longer; 15,000 nucleotides or longer; 20,000 nucleotides or longer; 50,000 nucleotides or longer; or 100,000 nucleotides or longer.\n  \n    \n    [0108]\n   Preliminary modeling suggests that, in order to allow proper tracking of lineage information, an ideal system would provide at least two mutations per generation per scratchpad. To track about 10 generations, about 100 target sites should be sufficient.\n  \n    \n    [0109]\n   A genetic scratchpad comprises multiple target sites, as depicted in the exemplary genetic scratchpads in FIGS. 2B and 2C. In some embodiments, each target site comprises a binding site that is recognized by a guide molecule such as a guide RNA (gRNA). In some embodiments, each target site comprises a target sequence or barcode associated with a guide molecule binding site.\n  \n    \n    [0110]\n    FIG. 2D illustrates an exemplary target site, for example, those corresponding to those depicted in FIG. 2C. In such embodiments, the target site comprises a guide sequence with a segment that is recognized by a gRNA. In some embodiments, the gRNA has a complementary sequence that allows the gRNA to bind to the guide sequence. In some embodiments, the sequence in the gRNA can be adjusted to modify the binding interactions between the gRNA and the guide sequence within a target site. Such adjustment is used to modulate the frequency at which the gRNA binds to the guide sequence and thereby modulating the frequency at which any molecular events that may occur upon binding between the gRNA and the guide sequence.\n  \n    \n    [0111]\n   In some embodiments, when a gRNA binds to its corresponding guide sequence, it recruits one or more secondary molecules, which then trigger one or more molecular changes. For example, an enzyme such as Cas9 nuclease can be recruited to the gRNA binding site. The nuclease then creates nicks or double-stranded break at the binding site, thereby destroying the structural integrity of a target site.\n  \n    \n    [0112]\n   In some embodiments, all or at least a part of the guide sequence is also recognized by a molecule that is used to characterize the integrity of a target site. For example, such a molecule can be a hybridization probe for fluorescence imaging analysis.\n  \n    \n    [0113]\n   In some embodiments, a target site further comprises a barcode or target sequence. All or at least a part of the barcode or target sequence is also recognized by a molecule that is used to characterize the integrity of a target site. For example, such a molecule can be a hybridization probe for fluorescence imaging analysis.\n  \n    \n    [0114]\n   In some embodiments, the length of the guide sequence is typically at least 20 nucleotides. However, guide sequences can be shorter or longer to modify their associated efficiency in recruiting secondary molecules. Additionally, to target multiple sequences, with a signal guide RNA molecule, guide sequences can be arranged in tandem with intervening spacer regions.\n  \n    \n    [0115]\n   In some embodiments where multiple scratchpads are present in a genome, each scratchpad can be independently written (e.g., via enzymatic cleavage of repetitive sequences) or using a genomic editing tool such as the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system (e.g., through a guide RNA and the Cas9 nuclease) (FIGS. 3A-3C). Presence of Cas9 and a specific guide RNA (gRNA) in the system leads to deletion of the scratchpad core, a change readily detected in bulk (FIG. 3) and in situ (FIG. 11).\n  \n    \n    [0116]\n   In one aspect, provided herein is a writing component that is capable of creating the molecular changes to be captured or recorded.\n  \n    \n    [0117]\n   In order to capture or record the molecular changes, a writing component should trigger or create molecular changes only in defined regions, for example, within a target site. This way, changes brought about by the molecular changes can be assessed in subsequent characterization analysis. To this end, a writing component comprises a guide molecule. The main function of the guide molecule is to recognize a desired target site. In some embodiments, the guide molecule is an RNA molecule that associates itself to the desired target site via complementary sequence recognition. In some embodiments, other molecules may facilitate the recognition and association between the guide molecule and the desired target site.\n  \n    \n    [0118]\n   In addition, the writing component comprises one or more secondary molecules that are capable of triggering or creating one or more molecular changes at the desired target site. In some embodiments, one or more secondary molecules are recruited by the guide molecule to the target site. In some embodiments, the guide molecule binds to a guide sequence first to form a complex, which is then recognized by one or more secondary molecules. In some embodiments, the guide molecule and one or more secondary molecules bind first before the complex recognizes and binds to the guide sequence at the target site.\n  \n    \n    [0119]\n   In some embodiments, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system, one of the most commonly used RNA-Guided Endonuclease technologies for genome engineering, can be used as a writing component. Exemplary embodiments of the CRISPR system are depicted in FIGS. 3A through 3C.\n  \n    \n    [0120]\n   In a CRISPR system, the guide molecule is a gRNA (e.g., FIG. 3A). When the gRNA binds to a guide sequence in the target site, it recruits secondary molecules (e.g., Cas9 nuclease) to trigger subsequent molecular changes: nicks or break in nucleotide sequences, which leads to various genetic mutations. Such genetic mutations include but are not limited to insertion mutation, deletion mutation, point mutations, multiple point mutations, any combination of such mutations, or any other changes at the nucleic acid level that can affect the binding of guide molecules such as gRNAs. Insertion and deletion mutations (also referred to as indel mutations) often lead to frame shift mutations leading to major disruptions in one or more genes, as illustrated in FIG. 3A. As such, probes designed to recognize the original target site will no longer be able to bind to the disrupted region. Alternatively, molecular changes include genetic modification. For example, a methyl-transferase can be fused to cas9 and target specific sites to alter the subsequent activity of a target site in one or more genetic scratchpads. Methylation on the DNA can be detected by bi-sulfite conversion, which turns unmethylated Cs to Us.\n  \n    \n    [0121]\n   A typical CRISPR system comprises two independent cassettes for expressing its two distinct components: (1) a guide RNA and (2) an endonuclease such as the CRISPR associated (Cas) nuclease, Cas9.\n  \n    \n    [0122]\n   The guide RNA is a combination of the endogenous bacterial crRNA and tracrRNA into a single chimeric guide RNA (gRNA) transcript. The gRNA combines the targeting specificity of the crRNA with the scaffolding properties of the tracrRNA into a single transcript. An exemplary gRNA expression cassette (e.g., FIG. 3B) depicts an RNA polymerase III or polymerase II specific promoter (box with an arrowhead), which drives the expression of a chimeric crRNA (middle rectangle) and tracrRNA (far right, shaded rectangle).\n  \n    \n    [0123]\n   An exemplary Cas9 expression cassette is found in FIG. 3C, which shows an RNA polymerase II promoter (rectangle with an arrowhead), an array of two binding sites for a repressor protein (TetR) and a \u201chumanized\u201d huCas9 open reading frame followed by poly A signal from the bovine growth hormone gene (dark, shaded rectangle). When the gRNA and the Cas9 nuclease are expressed in the cell, the genomic target sequence can be modified or permanently disrupted.\n  \n    \n    [0124]\n   The gRNA/Cas9 complex is recruited to the target sequence by the base-pairing between the gRNA sequence and the complement to the target sequence in the genomic DNA. In some embodiments, to ensure successful binding of Cas9, the genomic target sequence also contains the correct protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence immediately following the target sequence. The binding of the gRNA/Cas9 complex localizes the Cas9 to the genomic target sequence so that the wild-type Cas9 can cut both strands of DNA causing a double strand break (DSB). Cas9 cuts 3-4 nucleotides upstream of the PAM sequence.\n  \n    \n    [0125]\n   Recent publication (13, 14) and preliminary experiments suggest that Cas9 can be a suitable component for \u201cwriting\u201d random mutations into an engineered scratchpad region in the genome, where the scratchpad comprises many individually addressable target sites for the gRNA-Cas9 complex (FIGS. 2B and 2C). Aspects of the Cas9 system enable tuning of the rate of mutagenesis and scaling of the size of the target region.\n  \n    \n    [0126]\n    FIGS. 4A through 4F illustrate two exemplary schemes for creating genetic mutations into genetic scratchpads. In each one, a set of expression constructs (FIGS. 4A and 4D), a corresponding scratchpad (FIGS. 4B and 4E) and a schematic 3-generation lineage tree (FIGS. 4C and 4F) are shown. X's indicate mutations.\n  \n    \n    [0127]\n   In Scheme 1, the CRISPR system includes one Cas9 protein but multiple gRNAs (e.g., FIG. 4A). In some embodiments, the gRNAs are all under the control of a U6 promoter. Each gRNA binds to a unique target site in a genetic scratchpad and subsequently recruits the Cas9 nuclease to create a mutation at the target site (e.g., FIG. 4B). The site of the mutations may depend on the binding efficiency of the particular gRNA or the cutting efficiency of the Cas9 nuclease at the site.\n  \n    \n    [0128]\n   In some embodiments, multiple mutations accumulate over multiple cell cycle generations. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 4C, the genetic scratchpad of FIG. 4B leads to two possible mutations in its first generation offspring: one comprising a mutation at target site No. 2 and the other comprising a mutation at target site No. 5. The mutations are preserved in the offspring of these two first generation offspring.\n  \n    \n    [0129]\n   In some embodiments, additional mutations are created in addition to those carried over from the parent generation. In some embodiments, no additional mutations are created in one or more generations. For example, as depicted in FIG. 4C, in the next generation, no additional mutation is introduced into the scratchpad containing the mutation at target site No. 2. However, the scratchpad carrying the mutation at target site No. 5 leads to two offspring with double mutations: one with mutations at target site No. 3 and site No. 5 and the other at target site No. 1 and No. 5.\n  \n    \n    [0130]\n   In some embodiments, it is also possible for multiple mutations to occur in subsequent generations, such as two or more mutations, three or more mutations, or even five or more mutations. In order to keep the number of mutations under a reasonable limit and better assess lineage information between different generations, various methods (e.g., by applying mismatching sequences in a gRNA to adjust the rate at which it binds to a guide sequence) are applied to adjust the occurrence rate of mutations.\n  \n    \n    [0131]\n   In Scheme 2, only a single gRNA is used against multiple target sites (e.g., FIG. 4D). Here, instead of having unique gRNAs bind to different target site, each target site includes a unique barcode or target sequence to which unique probes can bind to reveal the presence of a particular target site (e.g., FIG. 4E). The detailed recognition mechanism will be described in the following section.\n  \n    \n    [0132]\n   Similar to the setup of Scheme 1, binding of the gRNA to a target site also ultimately leads to mutations after a Cas9 nuclease is recruited. Also similarly, such mutations can be preserved in future generations. Further, additional mutations can occur at different target sites in future generations of cells.\n  \n    \n    [0133]\n   As illustrated, lineage trees can be inferred from determination of the patterns of mutations (e.g., FIGS. 4C and 4F).\n  \n    \n    [0134]\n   Scheme 1 is optimized for single-cell DNA sequencing detection of mutations, while Scheme 2 is optimized for detection by multiplexed FISH (e.g., FIG. 5). In both schemes, the scratchpads can be transcribed from a promoter. The promoter can be either inducible or constitutive. Expression enables mutations to be read out by hybridization to RNA (FIG. 5).\n  \n    \n    [0135]\n   In one aspect, provided herein are methods and systems for characterizing the location of mutations in one or more genetic scratchpads.\n  \n    \n    [0136]\n   In some embodiments, single-cell sequencing techniques can be used to reveal the mutations in the target sites in one or more scratchpads before standard computational methods are applied to determine lineage relationships.\n  \n    \n    [0137]\n   In some embodiments, to readout the mutations made on the scratchpad in situ, a recently developed method is adapted to identify mutations in single cells within complex tissues while preserving spatial information. In some embodiments, the expression of the recording region into RNA is induced from an upstream inducible promoter (e.g., FIGS. 4A and 4D). This has two benefits. First, it allows the application of single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH or FISH) (18), which is already optimized for RNA detection. In addition, transcription amplifies the signal, as multiple copies of each mRNA are expressed from the scratchpad region, which enhances detection efficiency and accuracy.\n  \n    \n    [0138]\n   To uniquely distinguish the different target sites on the scratchpad, unique barcode sequences are engineered at each target site (FIG. 4E). FISH probes recognizing such unique sequence are designed to span the junction across the target site and the barcoded region, and are thus sensitive to mutations in or near the target. In some embodiments, these mutations are large insertions or deletions, which are readily detected by FISH probe hybridization.\n  \n    \n    [0139]\n   In some embodiments, it is possible to detect indels or minor mutations such as single point mutations and multiple point mutations. Recent work has shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on individual transcripts can be efficiently detected by 25 mer FISH probes (8).\n  \n    \n    [0140]\n   As disclosed herein, indel mutations are suitable molecular changes for a couple of reasons. First, indels are easier to detect than SNPs, since frameshifts are more disruptive to hybridization than mutations. Second, as the RNA is overexpressed from the reading template region, a large number of transcript copies can be analyzed in each cell, boosting the detectable signal.\n  \n    \n    [0141]\n   In some embodiments, probes used to recognize and bind to an mRNA transcript or a DNA sequence are oligonucleotides, or oligos. In some embodiments, the oligo probes are 10-mer or shorter. In some embodiments, the oligo probes are 15-mer or shorter. In some embodiments, the oligos are 20-mer or shorter; 25-mer or shorter; 30-mer or shorter; 40-mer or shorter; 50-mer or shorter; 70-mer or shorter; 100-mer or shorter; 150-mer or shorter; 200-mer or shorter; 250-mer or shorter; 300-mer or shorter; 500-mer or shorter; or 1,000-mer or shorter.\n  \n    \n    [0142]\n   In some embodiments, the oligo probes are designed by using complementary sequences to randomly selected sequences or segment of sequences in a target sequence (e.g., an mRNA or DNA sequence).\n  \n    \n    [0143]\n   In some embodiments, the oligo probes are designed by deliberately selecting sequences or segments of sequences that bind to a target site (e.g., an mRNA or DNA sequence) with known or predicted binding affinity. This is called \u201cintelligent probe design,\u201d where structure, sequence and biochemical data are all considered to create probes that will likely have better binding properties to a target site. In particular, the preferred regions to be used as target sites in a genome are either identified experimentally or predicted by algorithms based on experimental data or computation data. For example, computed binding energy and/or theoretical melting temperature can be used as selection criteria in intelligent probe design.\n  \n    \n    [0144]\n   Tools are available for automated designs of probes that will have either actual or predicted optimal binding properties to the target site. For example, the Designer program is routinely used for designing probes that bind to a particular target RNA sequence as part of the established single molecule RNA Fluorescent in-situ hybridization technology (FISH), which was developed at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) a Single Molecule Fluorescent in-situ hybridization technology based on detection of RNA (singlemoleculefish<dot>com/designer<dot>html). For the Designer program, the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene of interest is typically used as input. This approach is used to exclude the more repetitive regions and low complexity sequence contained in Un-translated Regions (UTRs). Probes are designed to minimize deviations from the specified target GC percentage. The program will output the maximum number of probes possible up to the number specified. Sequence input is stripped of all non-sequence characters. A user can specify parameters such as the number of probes, target GC content, length of oligonucleotide and spacing length. Most success has been achieved with target GC contents of 45%. Typically, oligos are designed as 20 nucleotides in length and are spaced a minimum of two nucleotides apart.\n  \n    \n    [0145]\n   One of skill in the art would also understand that length or size of probes will vary, depending on the target sites, genetic scratchpad and purposes of the analysis.\n  \n    \n    [0146]\n   Additional description on single molecule FISH can be found in, for example, Raj A., et al., 2008, \u201cImaging individual mRNA molecules using multiple singly labeled probes,\u201d Nature Methods 5(10): 877-879; Femino A., et al., 1998, \u201cVisualization of single RNA transcripts in situ,\u201d Science 280: 585-590; Vargas D., et al., 2005, \u201cMechanism of mRNA transport in the nucleus,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. of USA 102: 17008-17013; Raj A., et al., 2006, \u201cStochastic mRNA synthesis in mammalian cells,\u201d PLoS Biology 4(10):e309; Maamar H., et al., 2007, \u201cNoise in gene expression determines cell fate in B. subtilis,\u201d Science, 317: 526-529; and Raj A., et al., 2010 \u201cVariability in gene expression underlies incomplete penetrance,\u201d Nature 463:913; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n  \n    \n    [0147]\n   Any suitable labels can be associated with the specific probes to allow them to emit signals that will be used in subsequence imaging analysis. In some embodiments, the same type of labels can be attached to different probes for different target sites.\n  \n    \n    [0148]\n   One of skill in the art would understand that choices for a label are determined based on a variety of factors, including, for example, size, types of signals generated, manners attached to or incorporated into a probe, properties of the target sites including their locations within the cell, properties of the cells, types of interactions being analyzed, and etc.\n  \n    \n    [0149]\n   In some embodiments, all the target sites on the scratchpad are scanned to determine the target sites that are mutated in each cell. In some embodiments, a method to multiplex mRNA detection in single cells in situ is applied. In this approach, the mRNAs in cells are barcoded by sequential rounds of hybridization, imaging, and probe stripping (FIGS. 5A through 5C). As the transcripts are fixed in cells, the fluorescent spots corresponding to single mRNAs remain in place during multiple rounds of hybridization, and can be aligned to read out a color sequence at each point in the cell. This temporal barcode is designed to uniquely identify an mRNA species in a multiplexed experiment. During each round of hybridization, each transcript is targeted by FISH probes labeled with one dye. The sample is imaged and treated to remove the FISH probes. Then the mRNA is hybridized in a subsequent round with the same FISH probes labeled with a different dye. The number of barcodes available with this approach scales as FN, where F is the number of fluorophores and N is the number of hybridization rounds. For example, with 4 dyes, 8 rounds of hybridization can cover the entire transcriptome (48=65,536).\n  \n    \n    [0150]\n   Using FISH and fluorescent microscopy to analyze mutation events has the significant advantage compared to DNA-seq that single cells do not need to be extracted from tissues. Spatial context is preserved. For example, it is possible with this approach to visualize individual cells within a brain slice to determine the mutation set in each of those cells. This not only preserves the spatial information, but is less labor and cost intensive to perform. With conventional fluorescent microscopy, a 1 mm\u00d71 mm\u00d71 mm region can be scanned in approximately 5 minutes. The entire mouse brain can be imaged in 100 hours. With an automated microscope, 4 rounds of hybridization can be performed in 2-3 weeks. The overall cost of the microscope time and reagents will be approximately $10-50 k per brain. In comparison, single cell DNA sequencing costs approximately $10 per cell at the present, and dissecting out more than 1000 cells would be prohibitively labor intensive and cost prohibitive. Lastly, it is possible to apply this approach to CLARITY (9) cleared brains to obtain lineage information directly from intact brains.\n  \n    \n    [0151]\n    FIGS. 5A through 5C depict an exemplary process for detecting mutations in a genetic scratchpad by RNA hybridization FISH. FISH probes used here include sequence that binds to all or a part of guide sequence and all or a part of the barcode or target sequence adjacent or near the guide sequence. Fluorescent signals are only emitted when the FISH probes bind to un-mutated sequences. Disruption of either sequence will lead to loss of signal.\n  \n    \n    [0152]\n   As disclosed previous, disruption by Cas9 results in mutations in the guide sequence (e.g., insertion, deletion or point mutations). Such mutations, in particular, the insertion and deletion mutations prevent a FISH probe from binding to both the guide sequence and/or barcode sequence.\n  \n    \n    [0153]\n   Here, scratchpads are expressed as mRNAs to enable detection of mutations using FISH probes in individual cells. Using sequential rounds of hybridization (Hybs. 1, 2, 3, . . . ) multiple target sites can be probed simultaneously in single cells. In each round of hybridization, a mutation is targeted by a FISH probe with the same sequence but a different dye (e.g., FIG. 5A). Thus, each mutation can be addressed by a particular dye sequence.\n  \n    \n    [0154]\n   For example, the genetic scratchpad here contains 3 mutations, at target sites No. 2, No. 3 and No. 5. In three rounds of hybridization, probes recognizing different target sites are as follows.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nProbe Color\nProbe Color\nProbe Color\n\n\n \nMutation?\n(Round 1)\n(Round 2)\n(Round 3)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTarget site No. 1\nNo\nBlue\nGreen\nRed\n\n\nTarget site No. 2\nYes\nBlue\nGreen\nOrange\n\n\nTarget site No. 3\nYes\nGreen\nOrange\nRed\n\n\nTarget site No. 4\nNo\nGreen\nOrange\nBlue\n\n\nTarget site No. 5\nYes\nRed\nOrange\nGreen\n\n\nTarget site No. 6\nNo\nBlue\nGreen\nBlue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    [0155]\n   After the mutations, only intact target sites are able to produce fluorescent signals. Sequential hybridizations determine which transcripts are both present and do not contain mutations.\n  \n    \n    [0156]\n   At each hybridization step, cells are imaged in all channels. Color dots in cells correspond to probes hybridizing to indicated transcripts (FIG. 5B). Each round of hybridization results in a snapshot of the cell containing multiple fluorescent signals. Here, it is possible to detect the signal from the same target site multiple times, because multiple copies of mRNA can be synthesized.\n  \n    \n    [0157]\n   Because the characterization is done in situ without disrupting the structural integrity of the cells, it is possible to observe multiple color sequences for the same target site after each round of hybridization. The order by which the color signals appear forms a unique code for identifying the particular target site.\n  \n    \n    [0158]\n   By multiplying or, more generally, cross-correlating images in different rounds of hybridization, one can specifically detect the color sequence of any desired transcript. For example, here the intact target site No. 6 is uniquely detected by combining the blue Hyb 1 image with the green Hyb 2 image and the blue Hyb 3 image (FIG. 5C).\n  \n    \n    [0159]\n   As listed in the table above, by alternating the colors of different probes and applying multiple round of hybridization, each target site corresponds to a particular color sequence code. Here, intact site No. 1 will produce blue, green, and red signals in the order specified. Intact site No. 4 will produce red, orange, and green signals in the order specified. Intact site No. 6 will produce blue, green, and blue signals in the order specified.\n  \n    \n    [0160]\n   One of skill in the art would understand that, when more target sites are involved, more rounds of hybridization will be performed to establish color code sequences that can sufficiently and uniquely identify any intact target site\n  \n    \n    [0161]\n   In some embodiments, other in situ readout methods can also be applied to characterize the mutation status of target sites with one or more genetic scratchpads. Beyond RNA FISH, it is possible to use DNA FISH for in situ readout of recorded events. Expression changes to fluorescence reporters could also be used (in both live and fixed cells), though limits on the number of distinct fluorophore colors could cap the number of recordable events. Other readout methods could also provide in situ-like information, such as single-cell sequencing or PCR when implemented to preserve spatial information. Further, multiple techniques (including single-cell sequencing and PCR) could be readily applied to verify population averages.\n  \n    \n    [0162]\n   Methods and systems described herein enable the reconstruction of lineage trees based on the historical record of induced mutations recorded in scratchpads. More importantly, the recorded information can include data on specific molecular events that occurred in each branch of the tree over time. Exemplary events include but are not limited to activation of master transcription factors or signaling pathways.\n  \n    \n    [0163]\n   To achieve event recording, provided herein are strategies for simultaneously recording lineage information and molecular events.\n  \n    \n    [0164]\n   In some embodiments, constitutive and conditional focused mutagenesis systems are coupled. In an exemplary embodiment, a set of gRNAs is activated by a particular constitutive promoter, and is identical with the system discussed previously in connection with event writing. Each additional set will be conditional, being activated by a transcription factor of interest. It will consist of a promoter sensitive to that transcription factor driving a distinct gRNA, which will in turn target a distinct set of barcoded spacers in scratchpad target sites. Reading out of genotypes, as previously described, will be extended to include the additional scratchpads regions. The key idea is that the conditional systems will generate mutations only during intervals when the corresponding gRNA is expressed. By superimposing mutagenic events from the constitutive and signal-dependent gRNAs, one can reconstruct not just the lineage tree, but also the branches in which signaling events occurred (e.g., FIG. 6).\n  \n    \n    [0165]\n   In the exemplary embodiment depicted in FIG. 6, multiple focused mutagenesis systems are used, each of which utilizes a distinct set of gRNAs and corresponds to a genetic scratchpad.\n  \n    \n    [0166]\n    FIGS. 6A through 6C illustrate that event recording can be integrated into the lineage tracking system using an intersectional strategy. FIG. 6A depicts an exemplary design of one potential event recording system. Cas9 is expressed from a cell cycle dependent promoter and a constitutive promoter drives one guide RNA (gRNA1), as above. In addition, two signal-dependent promoters drive distinct gRNAs (e.g., gRNA2 and gRNA3) that target additional corresponding scratchpads (e.g., FIG. 6B). As a result, signaling events that occur during development can be recorded alongside lineage information, as indicated schematically by the mutations (X's) in (FIG. 6C). While mutations associated with the constitutive promoter can occur during any cell cycle, the mutations controlled by signal-dependent promoters can be turned on and off. This way, certain mutations (e.g., those associated with gRNA2 and gRNA3) are induced only in specific cell cycle.\n  \n    \n    [0167]\n   Signaling pathways provide a model system for recording known inputs. In some embodiments, signaling pathways such as BMP, SHH, and Notch will be analyzed by the methods and systems disclosed herein. Such pathways are critical for diverse developmental processes, easy to manipulate with external ligands and pharmacological inhibitors, and in active use in the lab.\n  \n    \n    [0168]\n   In some embodiments, these pathways will be activated or inhibited in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) containing corresponding recording systems utilizing pathway specific sensors incorporating multimerized binding sites for Smad and CSL transcription factors, respectively.\n  \n    \n    [0169]\n   Focused mutagenesis can enable \u201canalog\u201d recording of event intensity. Stronger signaling events are expected to induce higher expression of corresponding gRNAs, which could increase the mutation rate. As a result, the number of mutations accumulated in any given cell cycle could provide an indication not just of whether a transcription factor was active, but also of how strongly activated it was. To work, the mutation rate and number of target sites must be tuned to the dynamic range of the signal-dependent gRNA promoters. To explore this possibility, the relationship between ligand level and number of mutations induced will be systematically measured using the above signal pathways.\n  \n    \n    [0170]\n   The event recording methods and systems disclosed herein can be used to analyze ES differentiation. In some embodiments, the methods and systems can be used to record the activation of master transcription factors that activate specific lineages under conditions of heterogeneous differentiation. In some embodiments, facts determined from gene expression (antibody staining or single-molecule RNA FISH) are correlated with records of transcription factor activation recorded in the scratchpad of the same cell.\n  \n    \n    [0171]\n   As illustrated, the mutation status can be characterized in mammalian cells as well as simpler eukaryotic or even prokaryotic cells. In some embodiments, individual images of a cell population of interest are collected at different time points over a period of time. In some embodiments, continuous video images are collected over a period of time. In some embodiments, the period of time for image collection can cover any duration of time; for example, it can be over two cell cycle generations or longer, three cell cycle generations or longer, four cell cycle generations or longer, five cell cycle generations or longer, six cell cycle generations or longer, seven cell cycle generations or longer, eight cell cycle generations or longer, nine cell cycle generations or longer, 10 cell cycle generations or longer, 12 cell cycle generations or longer, 15 cell cycle generations or longer, 20 cell cycle generations or longer, 30 cell cycle generations or longer, 40 cell cycle generations or longer, 50 cell cycle generations or longer, 75 cell cycle generations or longer, or 100 cell cycle generations or longer.\n  \n    \n    [0172]\n   In one aspect, provided herein are methods and systems for establishing or reconstructing lineage tree for a cellular process or pathway.\n  \n    \n    [0173]\n    FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate an exemplary schematic of lineage tree reconstruction based on scratchpad state. FIG. 7A depicts a scratchpad implementation including a region targeted for deletion (colored in gray in the left) and a unique barcode (in rainbow color on the right). FIG. 7B shows a lineage tree that is constructed based on deletions in the scratchpad (labeled as \u201cx\u201d in the figures). In particular, cells with common ancestors can be identified to reconstruct a lineage tree.\n  \n    \n    [0174]\n   The method yields single-cell information and is not restricted to coarse-grained population measurements. It can also provide single-cell-cycle resolution: by adjusting the rate of scratchpad mutation, the time resolution of the technique can be tuned. In particular, mutation rates resulting in at least a few scratchpad mutations per cell cycle enable the reconstruction of lineage trees with single-cell resolution.\n  \n    \n    [0175]\n   For example, lineage trees can be reconstructed based on inherited changes in each cell's scratchpad state. By reading out the accumulated changes in each cell, we can infer the most likely lineage history of a population of cells (FIGS. 7 and 12). Genomic changes induced by our method are deliberately tuned to occur more frequently than somatic mutations and are in defined locations, which provide improved lineage information (at single-cell resolution) and easier readout, respectively. Moreover, methods relying on somatic mutations are not currently amenable to in situ readout of the lineage information.\n  \n    \n    [0176]\n   The methods and systems disclosed herein are also ideal for applications beyond lineage tracking, including event recording in single cells and tissues. By using multiple variants of scratchpads and writing components, different types of events can be recorded in parallel. And, this method makes it possible to resolve the timing of these events by using lineage tracking principles to map inherited mutations backward in time. Transcriptional, signaling, and other cellular events can be recorded in the genome. Ultimately, this history can be read out and the cell's or tissue's history reconstructed.\n  \n    \n    [0177]\n   Beyond lineage analysis, the system described herein has many additional applications. In some embodiments, the methods and systems disclosed herein can be used to record events leading to tumor genesis or metastasis in tissue and animal models, thereby facilitating understanding of mechanisms underlying tumor formation or migration. In some embodiments, the impact of treatments identified to disrupt tumor genesis or metastasis can be assessed with this same approach.\n  \n    \n    [0178]\n   In some embodiments, the methods and systems disclosed herein are used to identify one or more triggering events for tumor genesis or metastasis. In particular, in some embodiments, it is possible to identify signaling events that give rise to oncogenesis. For example, it is established that gRNA expression can be driven by promoters recognized by RNA polymerase II, therefore, signaling events that give rise to gene expression can also be used to express specific gRNAs. By coupling signal dependent mutagenesis, to a constitutive rate of mutagenesis, as described above, one will be able to identify the series of pathway events that were activated within the cells of a tumor and at what point in the lineage history of the tumor those signaling events occurred.\n  \n    \n    [0179]\n   In some embodiments, the methods and systems disclosed herein are used to identify early activation events in neural development. For example, by coupling gRNA expression to neuronal activity via an early response promoter, such as that driving cFos expression, one will be able to identify the activation history of a given progenitor by coupling the conditional mutagenesis to the constitutive mutagenesis, as described above.\n  \n    \n    [0180]\n   In some embodiments, the methods and systems disclosed herein are used to record changes in membrane potential and activation within post-mitotic neurons and other excitable cell types. As disclosed above, one can achieve conditional gRNA expression with the use of an early response promoter. Optimal CRISPR function may be achieved by balancing gRNA efficiency with gRNA turnover, ensuring that changes in membrane potential of a predetermined strength or duration would be accompanied by mutagenesis. Furthermore, by employing multiple, differentially tuned, gRNAs with unique target recognition, one may be able to record events arising from action potentials of various strengths and durations. Using the same approach, one can condition optimized gRNA expression to genes associated with neurodegeneration, such as Tau or beta amyloid. In this way, events would only be recorded in those neurons overexpressing these genes. Additionally, the magnitude of mutagenesis incorporated into the scratchpad in a given neuron would identify it as the possible origin of the pathogenesis.\n  \n    \n    [0181]\n   In some embodiments, once key events and key players are identified, it is possible to design or screen for target-specific therapeutics.\n REFERENCES\n \n  \n1.

Furthermore, it should be appreciated that all examples in the present disclosure are provided as non-limiting examples.\n EXAMPLES\n \n    \n    [0192]\n   The following non-limiting examples are provided to further illustrate embodiments of the invention disclosed herein. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent approaches that have been found to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute examples of modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.\n Example 1\nCRISPR System Deletes Portions of Genetic Scratchpads\n \n    \n    [0193]\n    FIGS. 8A and 8B demonstrate that the CRISPR system can write on a genetic scratchpad and results in deletions of portions of sequences of the scratchpad.\n  \n    \n    [0194]\n    FIG. 8A shows the result of bulk PCR of scratchpad in mammalian cells. Scratchpad remains intact in the absence of both gRNA and Cas9, but can be deleted when Cas9 and gRNA are both expressed. A band representing cut scratchpads is clearly visible when both gRNA and Cas9 are present, but absent when either component is missing.\n  \n    \n    [0195]\n    FIG. 8B shows the results of individual yeast clones analysis. Here, efficient removal by the CRISPR system of most repeats of a repetitive scratchpad core is clearly observed, as indicated by multiple bands corresponding to loss of repetitive sequences from a scratchpad core. This writing approach is applicable in many organisms, including mammalian and yeast cells.\n Example 2\nTuning of CRISPR System\n \n    \n    [0196]\n   This example illustrates that the cutting efficiency of Cas9 protein in the CRISPR system can be adjusted. As part of this system, Cas9 activity can be tuned through a variety of promoters, mutations, and accessory peptide fusions.\n  \n    \n    [0197]\n   Guide RNAs can also be tuned through the use of mismatched gRNA sequences (FIG. 9), the presence of decoy gRNA, gRNA copy number control, gRNA expression from inducible promoters, and gRNA expression from atypical geometries, such as from introns. Writing can also be achieved via other systems that can alter the DNA scratchpad, including recombinase and integrase enzymes.\n  \n    \n    [0198]\n   As shown in FIG. 9, mismatched gRNAs are one way to tune the rate of scratchpad cutting with the CRISPR system. Mismatched gRNA are not fully complementary to their target site and alter the efficiency of scratchpad cutting. gRNA less complementary to their scratchpad target show reduced (or no) cutting efficiency via bulk PCR.\n Example 3\nIn Situ Characterization of Scratchpad and Mutation Status\n \n    \n    [0199]\n   Our method is ideal for in situ readout of events from individual cells or tissues. By using RNA FISH, we are able to visualize changes in the transcribed DNA that result from our multiple recorded events.\n  \n    \n    [0200]\n   One implementation of this involves transcription of scratchpads from their promoters and subsequent labeling of these nascent transcripts via RNA FISH. The presence or absence (if deletion occurred) of each scratchpad as well as its uniquely identifying downstream barcode region (FIGS. 10 and 11) were visualized.\n  \n    \n    [0201]\n    FIGS. 10A and 10B show scratchpads visualized by FISH in single cells. In FIG. 9A, a colony of mouse embryonic stem cells (red nuclei) that grew from a single cell show RNA FISH images of the scratchpad transcript (blue; seen here as one large dot). In FIG. 9B, yeast cells (blue nuclei) also show scratchpad transcripts (pink) by FISH.\n  \n    \n    [0202]\n    FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate scratchpad deletion observed by FISH. In both 10A and 10B, in cells lacking gRNA expression, scratchpad transcripts continue to be observed by FISH (blue dots). However, in cells transfected with a strong gRNA (identified by a co-transfection marker (green)), scratchpad transcripts (blue) are no longer present.\n Example 4\nSingle Cell Scratchpad Analysis\n \n    \n    [0203]\n   In this example, single cell scratchpad changes read out by FISH are used to accurately reconstruct of lineage trees.\n  \n    \n    [0204]\n    FIG. 12A shows snapshots from a movie of ES cell colony formation. The bright cell in the top left image underwent three rounds of division, resulting in eight cells. These cells contained scratchpads, Cas9, and gRNA that targeted the scratchpads for deletion over time. FIG. 12B shows the images of the final colony (green cells) by FISH of scratchpad transcripts (blue), which were used to identify cells that retained or lost scratchpads. Four of the eight cells in this colony lost their scratchpads. Based on this information, these four cells most likely underwent a scratchpad deletion event in their common ancestor and are cousins belonging to a subclade of that ancestor.\n  \n    \n    [0205]\n    FIG. 12C shows the schematic of the maximum likelihood lineage tree inferred from FISH observations in these eight cells. The accuracy of this tree can be confirmed here by comparison with the lineage directly observed for these cells in their colony formation movie (A, most frames not shown).\n Example 5\nSequential Barcoding to Multiplex RNA Detection in Single Cells\n \n    \n    [0206]\n   This example includes experimental data demonstrating successful sequential barcoding of transcripts in single cells, as described schematically in FIGS. 4A through 4C. Referring to FIG. 13, each dot corresponds to a distinct mRNA molecule in the cell. Three images (top left to right) show three rounds of hybridization: Hyb1, Hyb2 and Hyb3. Both Hyb1 and Hyb3 used the same labeled probes so dots colocalize, as shown in the lower panels. The lower left panel shows the zoomed in boxed region and the extracted barcodes, represented on the right, demonstrating co-localization of signals. Bottom right panels indicate interpretations of corresponding lower left panels.\n Example 6\nSimulated Recording and Multi-Generation Lineage Reconstruction\n \n    \n    [0207]\n   This example shows that accurate and robust algorithms can be used to reconstruct the lineage tree from a field of cells with mutagenized recording regions.\n  \n    \n    [0208]\n   Without the spatial information on cells, computer simulation showed that 100 target sites in the recording region are sufficient to faithfully generate a 10-generation deep lineage tree (FIGS. 14A and 14B). The recording region was readout in situ preserving the spatial organization of cells, it was possible to determine through additional simulations whether this provides an additional level of robustness into the reconstruction process as well as increases the number of generations that can traced with the same number of cutting sites.\n  \n    \n    [0209]\n    FIGS. 14A and 14B shows simulated recording region cut sites and reconstruction for a 6-generation lineage tree. In FIG. 14A, one cell was propagated for 6 generations to generate 64 descendant cells (y-axis). In each generation, a random target site from target sites No. 1-100 was cut per cell (x-axis). The recording region is shown at the end of the 6 generations. Here, a black box indicates that a target site (x axis) is mutated in a given cell, (y axis). In FIG. 14B, based on the data from FIG. 14A, a lineage tree was correctly reconstructed using Manhattan distance and complete linkage models (Mathematica).\n  \n    \n    [0210]\n   The various methods and techniques described above provide a number of ways to carry out the invention.
