The in-line di-lution is recommended to reduce the risk ofaggregation and to increase binding capacityduring SXC (further discussion in the ‘‘Results’’section).

In the examples shown below, thelatter encoded a yellow fluorescent protein(YFP) reporter cDNA driven by the cytomeg-alovirus (CMV) promoter.(3) Add TurboFect transfection reagent (8lL perwell), vortex the transfection solution, and incu-bate for 15 min at RT.(4) Carefully distribute 400lL of the mixture perwell and incubate the cells at 37°C for 72 h.(5) Scrape off the cells and transfer them to 15 mLtubes, before concentrating them by centrifuga-tion at 1,500 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for15 min. Remove the supernatant, resuspend thecells in 300lL PBS, and transfer into 2 mL tubes.The removed cell supernatant contains AAVparticles and can be directly processed as de-scribed in the ‘‘Sample Preparation for SXC’’section for purification with SXC.(6) Subject the samples to five cycles of freezing andthawing (5 min each) using a 37°C water bath andliquid nitrogen. This sample is called ‘‘virusharvest’’ hereafter.962MARICHAL-GALLARDO ET AL.  (7) Centrifuge the lysed solution at a minimum of10,000 rcf for 10 min to remove cell debris.(8) Store the supernatant containing the virus parti-cles (centrifuged virus harvest) at-80°Cin50lLaliquots.AAV vector stock production—medium scale(1) Produce medium-scale AAV vector stocks in15 cm dishes by seeding 4.5·106HEK293T cellsper well in 22 mL DMEM and by incubatingthem at 37°C and 5% CO2for 48 h.(2) Prepare the transfection mixture in 4 mL DMEMwithout  any  supplements  by  adding  equalamounts of the three plasmids (14.6lg per plas-mid, in total 43.8lg of DNA) as for the smallscale above. The amounts are given for one15 cm dish and can be expanded. (3) Add 140lL polyethylenimine (PEI) (1 mg/mL)transfection reagent for each plate to the mastermix, vortex the transfection solution, and incu-bate for 30 min at RT.(4) Carefully distribute 4 mL of the mixture per dishand incubate the cells at 37°C for 72 h.(5) Scrape the cells from the dishes, pooling at leastfive dishes per AAV construct, and centrifuge for20 min at 1,500 rcf. Remove the supernatant andresuspend the cell pellet in 6 mL of virus lysisbuffer. The removed cell supernatant containsAAV particles and can be directly processed asdescribed in the ‘‘Sample Preparation for SXC’’section for purification with SXC.(6) Subject the samples to five cycles of freezing andthawing (5 min each) using a 37°C water bath andliquid nitrogen.(7) Sonicate the sample for 1 min 20 s. 8) Add 75 U/mL Benzonase to the virus-containingsolution and keep the sample for 1 h at 37°C,inverting it every 10 min.(9) Centrifuge the lysed solution twice for 15 min at4,000 rcf, 4°C to remove cell debris.(10) Store the solution at-20°C in 50 mL Falcontubes.Sample preparation for SXC(1) Clarify the centrifuged virus harvests (cell lysateand supernatant) by microfiltration (cellulose ac-etate filters are appropriate, Table 1). A final poresize of 0.2lm is recommended. In case a 0.2lmfilter is blocked with the centrifuged material fromstep (7) described in the ‘‘AAV Vector StockProduction—Small Scale’’ section, the blockagecan be reduced and the risk of product losses dueto clogged filters is minimized by using a cascadeof filters (e.g., 0.8, 0.45, and 0.2lm is often ap-propriate). The filtered sample is named ‘‘clarifiedcell lysate virus harvest’’ and ‘‘clarified superna-tant virus harvest’’ hereafter (Fig. 1A).(2) Add the required amount of PEG stock to theclarified virus harvest to achieve the final PEGconcentration of 10% needed to capture the AAVparticles during SXC. Use the following formulato calculate the needed volume of PEG stock:VPEGstock¼%PEGfeedVfeed32%:(a) Example: for preparing 10 mL of PEG-conditionedsample at 10% PEG-6000:Vfeed=10 mL%PEGfeed=10%VPEGstock=10·10/32=3.125 mL(i) In this example, the volume of clarified virus har-vest to be purified has to be equal or lower than10 mL-3.125 mL=6.875 mL. The clarified virusharvest can be diluted with 1·PBS to reach thisvolume.(b) Example: if using a chromatography system with abinary pump, a 1:1 in-line dilution of the clarifiedvirus harvest with 20% PEG-6000, 1·PBS ishighly recommended over conditioning the samplewith PEG off-line (further discussion in the ‘‘Re-sults’’ section).Assembly of SXC filter unitThis filter unit can be used for either purification using achromatography system (the ‘‘SXC Using a LiquidChromatography System’’ section) or manual purificationwith a syringe (the ‘‘SXC Performed Manually with aSyringe’’ section). The filter unit is alternatively called acolumn. Assemble the column components in the orderstated in Fig. 1B:(1) Stack up to 20 membranes (100 cm2) and placethem on top of the stainless steel mesh inside thefilter housing.(2) Add a plastic flat gasket on top of the membranes(optional). The plastic gasket is meant for the veryrare situation in which a part of the membranepops out from the inner diameter of the rubberO-ring while screwing the device. This can causethe fluid to flow through the filter unit withouttouching the membranes, leading to product lossduring purification. This optional gasket helpskeep the membranes in place. Additionally, asecond metal mesh can be placed on top of themembranes instead of the flat gasket.(3) Add the O-ring. A rubber O-ring is recommendedbecause it is flexible and it seals the device bettercompared with a rigid gasket.(4) Screw the top part of the housing without over-tightening. With the materials stated here and astack of 20 membranes, a tightened assembledcolumn with a height of£17.60 mm is unlikely toleak. However, the column can be tested for leaksby flushing it with 5–10 mL of binding buffer us-ing a syringe at a speed of 5–10 mL/min or directlyin the chromatography system.(a) Note: The experimenter can also use filter hous-ings with a smaller diameter, for example, 14 mmat the expense of lower binding capacity andslightly more back pressure during purification,which is especially noticeable when purifyingsamples manually with a syringe.(b) Note: Teflon tape can be used for sealing thethread of the housing to reduce the risk of leaksand to protect the screw, which can be damagedover time (e.g., due to tightening without properaligning).(c) Although the bed volume of the compressed stackof twenty 2.5 cm membranes is around 0.4 mL, forpractical purposes, the column volume (CV) canbe defined as 1 mL.SXC using a liquid chromatography systemSXC with a chromatography system is always re-commended over a manual purification. A FPLC systemprovides controlled flow rates, pressures, the possibility toperform gradients, online monitoring of process variablessuch as ultraviolet (UV) absorbance and conductivity, and cutoffs above 50 kDa are recommended to fully eliminatetraces of PEG that might remain in the samples with a poresize of 14 kDa or less. Using 300 kDa is standard practicefor AAV particles, even for concentration/diafiltrationsteps at industrial scale with cross-flow filtration.(1) Rinse the dialysis membranes in a beaker withwater.(2) Prepare the dialysis solution with the buffer ofchoice. A sample-to-buffer ratio of 1:1,000 is re-commended and 1:200 is sufficient.(3) Place the sample inside the dialysis tubes and sealthem tight.(4) Start dialysis under stirring, at best at 4°C. Withpore sizes of 100 kDa and above, 4 h are typicallysufficient for a full buffer exchange with a 1:1,000sample-to-buffer ratio, but the dialysis can beperformed overnight.(a) As a general rule, AAV particles can be formu-lated in 1·PBS, 350 mM NaCl, and 5% (v/v)sorbitol (or glycerol).6,27(b) Particle aggregation of AAV can be minimized byusing divalent ion salts, for example, 200 mMmagnesium sulfate. Non-ionic surfactants such asPluronic F68 at a concentration of 0.001% (v/v)can also be used.14Reporter activity assay to monitorin vitrotransgene expression in cells transducedwith SXC-purified AAVCells are fed with the SXC-purified AAV particles, andthe transduction rates and mean fluorescence intensities ofthe YFP/GFP reporter-encoding AAV vector are deter-mined by microscopy.(1) Transduce  susceptible  cells  (e.g.,  HEK293T,SF539, U87, or monocyte-derived macrophages)with SXC-purified AAV particles at different di-lutions in a total volume of 80lL per well in a 96-well plate. Incubate the cells for 36–48 h at 37°Cand 5% CO2in a humidified atmosphere.(2) Fix the cells with 80lL per well of fixing solutionat RT for 30 min, and afterward, treat the cellswith Hoechst staining solution to label nuclei. Forimmunofluorescence analysis, use respective pri-mary and secondary antibody combinations. In thefollowing, the procedure used for the examplesshown in Fig. 5 is described. Incubate cells for10 min with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100,followed by 30 min incubation with 5% fetal bo-vine serum (FBS) in PBS. Dilute the primary an-tibody according to the datasheet in 5% FBS inPBS and incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at4°C. Wash the cells three times with PBS for 5 mineach. Add Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibody(1:1,000 diluted in 5% FBS) and counterstain withHoechst for 2 h at RT in the dark. Wash the cellsthree times with PBS.(3) Use a fully automated microscope for image ac-quisition, such as the Olympus Biosystems IX81microscope.(4) Acquire images in the Hoechst and in the reporterchannel with a 10·objective in nine differentpositions.(5) Perform an automated image analysis consisting ofthree successive steps: (i) cell nuclei segmentationin the Hoechst channel, (ii) cell segmentation inthe reporter channel, and subsequent (iii) greyvalue quantification of the identified objects. Au-tomated image analysis is performed to determinethe reporter mean intensities and to classifytransduced and nontransduced cells, as well as todetermine the mean intensity of target proteinsafter AAV-mediated knockdown. Further detailsof the entire workflow are published elsewhere.26Determination of AAV genomes via DropletDigitalÔPCRSample preparation via alkaline lysis of AAV particles:(1) Incubate AAV lysates with 50 U/mL Benzonasefor 1 h at 37°C.(2) Spin down cell debris by centrifugation at 3,750rcf for 20 min.(3) For alkaline lysis of AAV capsids, dilute thesamples 1:2 in TE (DNA/DNase-free) to a finalvolume of 20lL.(4) Add 20lL of 2 M NaOH to the previous sampleand mix well.(5) Incubate sample for 30 min at 56°C.(6) Stop the alkaline lysis by adding 38lLof1MHCl.(7) Dilute samples further to 1 mL with water, followedby an additional dilution step (1:100) with water.(a) Primers and probe are directed against the YFP/GFP sequence.(i) FAM-ACGACGGCAACTACA-BHQ1, primer for-ward 5¢-GAGCGCACCATCTTCTTCAAG-3¢andprimer reverse 5¢-TGTCGCCCTCGAACTTCAC-3¢.(b) For droplet generation, prepare a reaction mixcontaining:(i) 0.99 pmol of each primer, 0.275 pmol of probe,and 11lLof2·ddPCR (Droplet Digital PCR)supermix for probes (Bio-Rad Laboratories).(ii) Add 2.2lL of water and 5.5lL of sample. ddPCR: droplets are generated with a QX200 DropletGenerator using droplet generation oil for probes (all Bio-Rad Laboratories).(8) Transfer droplet-containing samples to a Twin.tec96-well PCR plate (Bio-Rad Laboratories) andseal it with Foil Seals for PCR and QX200 ddPCRapplication (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the PX1PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad Laboratories).(9) Carry out the PCR in a C1000 Touch ThermalCycler using the following protocol with the ramprate set to 2°C per cycle:Temperature (°C)Time9410 min9430 s40·6060 s9810 min12Hold(10) Subsequently, droplets are subjected to a QX200Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).(11) Analyze the raw data with the correspondingsoftware QuantaSoft 1.7 operating in combinedwell analysis mode.Evaluation of impurity depletionof SXC-purified AAV particlesFollow the manufacturer’s instructions for the totalprotein assay and the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as-say kits listed in Table 1. Construct a calibration curve thatfits the measured data. Beware that proper regressionanalysis has to be made to avoid the calculation of mis-leading results. Follow the recommendations of Ellisonet al.for regression analysis and statistical validation.28Asan alternative to the dsDNA and total protein quantifica-tion methods described here, we refer the reader toMarichal-Gallardoet al.22Additionally,  perform  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) withCoomassie or silver staining. The viral proteins VP1/2/3can be detected by Western blot (WB) with B1 antibody.Evaluation of physical integrityof SXC-purified AAV by negative stainingand transmission electron microscopyFor the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)analysis, use 300 mesh copper grids coated with 1.2%Pioloform and 3 nm carbon film, or similar.(1) Pioloform coating of the electron microscopy(EM) grids: place a clean microscopic glass slideinto a cylindrical separating funnel of a suitablesize, so that the slide is standing upright on thebottom of the funnel. Fill the funnel with 1.2%Pioloform solution to&2/3 of the glass slideheight. Release the Pioloform solution from thefunnel. In a clean vessel with water, slowly floatthe Pioloform film from the glass slide onto thewater surface. Lay the grids onto the film andavoid grids overlapping each other. Pick up thefilm with grids by a strip of parafilm. Let the gridsair-dry for at least 1–2 days.(2) Carbon coating of the EM grids: coat the grids onthe parafilm strip with a 3 nm thick layer of carbonin the Leica EM ACE600 (or equivalent carboncoater) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.(a) Note: If the grids are precoated by the manufac-turer, skip steps 1 and 2 and proceed directly tostep (3).(3) Glow-discharging of the coated EM grids: beforesample application, glow-discharge the grids to beused for 30 s in Pelco easiGlow (or equivalentglow-discharging unit).(4) Sample application and wash: apply 3–5lL of thesample to the grid for 5 min. Wash the grid twiceby briefly inverting it onto a*150lL drop ofwater. Remove water from the grid by carefullyblotting with Whatman Grade 1 qualitative filterpaper (cellulose, 11lm retention size).(5) PTA staining: proceed with staining by invertingthe grid onto a 5lL drop of 3% PTA, pH 7.5. Stainfor 2 min. Remove excess stain with the Whatmanpaper by blotting and let the grid air-dry.(6) TEM analysis: store the grids in a clean dry grid-box and analyze by TEM. For assessment ofparticle shape and integrity,>100,000-fold mag-nification is preferable.Analytical size-exclusion chromatographyPerform  size-exclusion  chromatography  (SEC)  toassess the purity of the AAV particles as reported byGagnon29using a packed-bead Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The sampleinjection volumes range from 100 to 500lL.","The mutual PEG exclusion by the cellulose surfaceand the virus particles favors their association without adirect chemical interaction. Several studies indicate thatCHROMATOGRAPHY OF AAV WITH CELLULOSE MEMBRANES967 molecular crowding with PEG in SXC follows many of therules as precipitation30–32: higher PEG concentration andlarger PEG size increase the effect, and larger solutes areaffected more than smaller ones. This allows the virusparticles, which become preferentially hydrated in thepresence of PEG, to bind at the surface of the cellulosemembrane.33–35Concurrently, impurities with lower hy-drodynamic diameter than the virus particles, such asDNA and protein, are washed away, effectively purifyingthe virus particles. Leeet  al.33provided an extensivediscussion on the variables involved in the performance ofSXC. For the theoretical and experimental background onSXC fundamentals and applications, we refer the reader toselected publications.23,30,31,36,37Product recoveryA typical SXC chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2A. Asobserved in the flow-through, there is no trace of virusparticles in the light-scattering signal, whereas the UVsignal indicates the depletion of protein, DNA, and otherimpurities. When the virus particles are eluted from thecolumn by flushing it with a buffer without PEG, the UVand light-scattering signals indicate the presence of AAVparticles.The absence of AAV particles in the flow-through wasconfirmed by PCR, indicating that 10% PEG-6000 isenough to prevent losses during sample loading. Theproduct recovery by PCR in the elution fractions was126.1%–10.9% (mean–standard error for serotypesAAV2, AAV6, AAV-1P5, and AAV-9A2; details on the capsid variants have been reported38). The estimated yieldabove 100% is attributed to the error of the PCR assay;similar recovery values have been reported in literaturebefore (e.g., 121%,39or 138%18). The high recovery ofdifferent AAV particles achieved with the membrane-based SXC protocol described here is consistent withprevious SXC results showing nearly full virus particlerecovery of different influenza virus (loading at 8%PEG-6000) and yellow fever virus strains (loading at 10%PEG-6000).25Biological activityIn vitroexpression of the transgene reporter was used toassess the biological activity of the purified AAV. Therewas no detectable reporter expression from the flow-through fractions, whereas eluted fractions showed robustexpression of the transgene reporter (Fig. 2B). This gen-eral trend was observed for several AAV serotypes andpeptide display mutants38that were tested, that is, AAV1,AAV2, AAV6, AAV8, AAV-DJP2, AAV-1P5, and AAV-9A2 (transgene reporter signals and transduction ratiosfrom selected AAV types at constant sample volumes usedfor initial screening of eluates are shown in SupplementaryFig S1).Figure 2C shows transgene reporter signals and trans-duction ratios at constant viral genome (vg) levels of SXCeluate fractions against an iodixanol-purified sample. Asdepicted, virtually, all cells were transduced with bothiodixanol- and SXC-purified samples. Expression of theYFP reporter for the cell lysate SXC eluates is comparableTable 2.Timelines for experimental proceduresTaskSectionaDurationAAV production3Cell seeding and transfection (small scale)3.11 hCell seeding and transfection (medium scale)3.2‡1 h (depending on plate numbers)Harvest of AAV particles30 min+1 h Benzonase treatmentAAV purificationSample preparation3.310 minColumn assembly and preparation3.45 minPurification of AAV particles with a chromatography system3.530 minPurification of AAV particles manually with a syringe3.615 minDialysis (optional) preferably with 300 kDa cutoff3.7‡4 h or overnightAnalyticsReporter assay for transgene expression3.8&5,000 cells per well for cell seeding;&16–24 h for cell attachment(note: it is also possible to directly add vector particles during cellseeding to save time)Total viral titer determination by PCR3.9‡3.5 hdsDNA assay3.1030 minTotal protein assay3.1030 minTEM3.1140 minAnalytical SEC3.1260 mindsDNA, double-stranded  DNA;  SEC,  size-exclusion  chromatography;  TEM, transmission electron microscopy.aRefer to the following sections in the text: 3, Experimental Procedure; 3.1, AAV Vector Stock Production—Small Scale; 3.2, AAV Vector Stock Production—Medium Scale; 3.3, Sample Preparation for SXC; 3.4, Assembly of SXC Filter Unit; 3.5, SXC Using a Liquid Chromatography System; 3.6, SXC Performed Manuallywith a Syringe; 3.7, Dialysis of Purified AAV Particles (Optional); 3.8, Reporter Activity Assay to MonitorIn VitroTransgene Expression in Cells Transduced withSXC-Purified  AAV;  3.9,  Determination  of  AAV  Genomes  via  Droplet  DigitaläPCR;  3.10,  Evaluation  of  Impurity  Depletion  of  SXC-Purified  AAV  Particles;  3.11,Evaluation   of   Physical   Integrity   of   SXC-Purified   AAV   by   Negative   Staining   and   Transmission   Electron   Microscopy;   3.12,   Analytical   Size-ExclusionChromatography. to the iodixanol-purified sample, whereas it is lower forthe cell supernatant and its SXC eluates. The variation ofYFP intensities among the SXC fractions could be due toresidual host cell impurities that influence cell trans-duction efficiency, as reported by Strobelet  al.40andTenenbaumet al.41Besides gene expression, a CPSF6 gene (cleavage andpolyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6) knockdownwas also evaluated as reported by Bejaranoet al.42andfound to be highly effective (Fig. 3). This further confirmsthe functionality of the SXC-purified AAV particles forboth gene expression and gene knockdown.PurityA SEC analysis of a clarified virus harvest before SXCpurification (Fig. 4A) shows the fingerprint of impuritiesdetected by UV absorbance. The light-scattering signalindicates the presence of AAV particles at a retention time of around 8 mL (column’s void volume). In contrast, theSEC fingerprint of the SXC-purified AAV particles(Fig. 4B) shows an overlap of the UV and light-scatteringsignals in the void with no major remaining contaminantsof>600 kDa detected by UV absorbance.Figure 5A and B shows a SDS-PAGE analysis of SXCpurifications of recombinant AAV9 in direct comparisonto conventional affinity or iodixanol purifications of theidentical serotype. As expected, the presence of VP1, VP2,and VP3 was confirmed in all major samples by WB aswas their absence in the SXC flow-through fractions, aspreviously observed by PCR. Notably, the VP1/2/3 bandsin the WB of SXC eluates appear to migrate differently asevidenced by their lower apparent molecular weightcompared with the VP bands detected in other samples.This is likely an artifact caused by the residual presence ofPEG, as previously reported by Arakawa and Gagnon.43Together with this seemingly different band migration behavior, the sample purity did not allow for a unanimousidentification of VP1/2/3 in the SXC eluates by silver stainanalysis. The SEC fingerprint in Fig. 4B suggests that theprotein impurities in the SXC eluates that are detected bysilver staining and that hinder the detection of VP1/2/3bands in this analysis are most probably incorporatedinto extracellular vesicles. Indeed, the latter have beenreported to be co-purified during SXC of virus particlesdue to their similar size.22A subsequent purification ofthe SXC eluates with affinity chromatography, whichspecifically enriches free AAV particles and removesexosomes (Supplementary Fig S2), further confirmed thisin the silver stain (Fig. 5A, B). This result highlights boththe clearly superior ability of affinity chromatography toremove contaminants as well as its compatibility andsynergism with SXC purification.Importantly, clearance of dsDNA—a major contami-nant inevitably occurring in, and confounding, AAVvector production—during SXC is typically>90%.22,25,33For the purification of cell lysates, dsDNA clearance measured by PicoGreen reagent ranged from 94% to 98%.In the case of total protein, the clearance ranged from 80%to 85% measured by the Bradford assay (SupplementaryTable S1). These clearance values match previously re-ported data for SXC of influenza and yellow fever virusparticles.25Only 6–18% of AAV particles produced by tripletransfection in HEK cells contain the transgene product,and full capsids should be enriched in the final prod-uct.13,14Figure 5C shows TEM pictures of crude lysatesand SXC-purified AAV particles. The purified virus par-ticles are homogeneous in shape and size with the ex-pected approximate diameter of 25 nm. From the AAVparticles observed in Fig. 2E, it seems the percentage ofempty AAV capsids in the purified samples is 16–18%.However, these preliminary results should be com-plemented by additional techniques that provide a moreaccurate and quantitative characterization of full andempty capsids compared with TEM analysis alone, such asanalytical ultracentrifugation, cryo-EM, or multiangle light scattering coupled to refractive index detection.8,15,44The reader is, moreover, referred to the chemistry,manufacturing, and control guidance for human genetherapy drugs published by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-ministration.45Additionally, Penaud-Budlooet al.providea summary on the current testing and specifications forAAV-based products purity and safety.14SXC device capacityUsing cell lysates, the capacity of the 100 cm2purifi-cation device used here was initially£2.87·1011vg(0.72·1012vg/mL) based on the highest titer recovered inthe elution pools from cell lysate experiments with noproduct detected in the flow-through (see SupplementaryTable S1 for selected examples). This initially estimatedcapacity was comparable to values reported by the man-ufacturers of commercially available products—typicallyreported at 5–10% of product breakthrough during loading—such as the AVB Sepharose affinity resin(>1012vg/mL).46The manufacturer of the POROSÔAAVX affinity resin reports a binding capacity of>1014vg/mL.47These perfusion particles are rigid and havelonger pores that transect the entire particle compared withthe shallow dead-end pores of the more traditional AVBSepharose media.We hypothesized that the observed capacity of the100 cm2SXC device used here might be higher based onthe observation that no virus particles were found in theflow-through and the fact that membranes and monolithstypically offer 10 to 100 times higher virus particle-binding capacities than porous beads.29We therefore performed additional SXC experimentswith a higher AAV challenge to the membrane. It waspossible to recover a total of 1.24·1013vg in 60 mL ofeluate from 830 mL of cell supernatant in around 3.4 hperforming four consecutive SXC runs with new SXC100 cm2devices for every run. Therefore, the calculatedcapacity of the 100 cm2device was 3.10·1012vg, ap-proximately one order of magnitude higher than initiallyestimated.SXC performanceIn-line mixing with the PEG stock was preferablecompared with the off-line sample conditioning, espe-cially for highly concentrated cell lysates. Adding theconcentrated PEG stock to the medium-scale lysates re-sulted in particle aggregation and hampered sample puri-fication (data not shown). As discussed in more detail byTimasheff23and Leeet al.,33in-line mixing with the PEGis encouraged because this way, the target product pref-erentially interacts with the stationary phase rather thanassociating with other particles in solution, effectivelyreducing the risk of aggregation. In-line mixing the PEG isalso advantageous because only the right amount ofsample is conditioned for the chromatography run.Elution of the virus particles can be accomplishedtheoretically in any buffer that does not contain PEG,which is an advantage of SXC over other techniques forAAV purification. Less ‘‘harsh’’ conditions are used forelution compared to, for example, low pH in affinitychromatography, or high salt in IEX, both of which couldperturb virus particle stability. Nevertheless, host cellimpurities, extracellular vesicles, total particle load, or theisoelectric point (pI, see further discussion below) of theproduct might modify elution patterns, and slight changesin conductivity during elution might improve productyields if they happen to be lower than expected (Supple-mentary Table S2).Besides the hydrodynamic size of the target product,the pI plays an important role in SXC because the amountof PEG needed to achieve binding has a minimum at the pIof the target product when keeping all other parametersconstant. Empty and full AAV capsids have different pI values16that might influence binding behavior duringSXC, making the separation of full from empty capsids anintriguing and exciting scope for future work.Overall, our results show that SXC is a promisingcapture method for purification of AAV particles from celllysates and cell supernatants using the same recipe re-gardless of their capsid and surface characteristics. SeveralAAV types, including multiple wild types, shuffled as wellas peptide-displaying AAV variants, were successfullypurified by loading at 10% PEG-6000 onto disposablecolumns packed with regenerated cellulose membranes of1.0lm pore size. The average recovery in elution poolsfrom cell lysates was 126.1%–10.9% by PCR. Theclearance of dsDNA was‡94%, and the depletion of totalprotein was‡80%. The purified AAV particles success-fully induced either gene expression or gene knockdownin vitro.The low cost of the membranes allows this operation tobe single-use and reduces process development time and cost by eliminating the need of cleaning and sanitizationsteps. As with other membrane chromatography methods,scale-up is done linearly by increasing the membranesurface. With further research and development, we be-lieve that SXC could be used at industrial scales with spiralwound devices with a membrane surface of around 20 m2.Such devices are commercially available (e.g., SartobindQ Jumbo, 5 L, 8 mm bed height) for other chromatographytechniques such as IEX.Importantly, the high recoveries observed after the initialcapture with SXC enable the use of subsequent additionalpurification steps (e.g., IEX, ultracentrifugation, ultrafil-tration/diafiltration to further deplete host cell protein,DNA, empty capsids, and residual PEG) without riskinglow product recoveries. Moreover, the AAV particles canbe loaded and recovered at physiological pH and salt con-centration. It is encouraged to load the unpurified samplesby in-line mixing with the PEG, as this strategy eliminatesthe need for sample conditioning beyond clarification Finally, the high flow rates that can be used with SXCalso offer the possibility of large-scale purification ofAAV particles from large volumes of cell supernatants,which is currently a very challenging task with widelyused purification methods such as density gradient ultra-centrifugation. As we have shown here, using SXC it waspossible to recover up to 1.24·1013vg in 3.4 h from830 mL of cell supernatant. In contrast, purifying the samevolume using a 1 mL affinity column would take at least46 h or 15 h of density gradient ultracentrifugation by sixrounds of 2.5 h each.Despite the need for further development of this newtechnology, we deem membrane-based SXC a versatileand low-cost promising method for the capture of AAVgene transfer vectors.",NA
